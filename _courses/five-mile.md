The five mile course is used for the summer and opening handicaps and other inter-club races.

Start at the foot of the small slope near the clubhouse door and run up the
right hand edge of the field. A little before the field corner drift right through a
gap in the hedge to join a track. Immediately fork left and then fork left again
on to a smaller path with a grassy area to your right. Just before this (short)
path bends left, keep straight and cross a large track and a plank bridge into
the trees. At the first junction, fork right and follow the path around to the
right. Cross a bridge over a ditch and immediately turn right following an
indistinct path to meet a track. Cross the track bearing slightly left.
Cross a second track after 300m and a third after a further 150m. Cross a
plank bridge and, about 100m later, fork left uphill. Emerge on to a grassy
area and turn left on to a sandy track (*ca. 1 mile*).

Take the first left downhill just before a bench on the right. Cross a stream
and turn right uphill. At the top bear right on to a major track and follow it to a
gate. Take the path to the right of the gate between a set of low posts.
Continue on this path to a second set of posts, go through them and cross a
road (point **A**). Swing right to follow a path on the left hand side of the road.
Turn left immediately left after a lone tree, continuing between a tee and a
road (North View). Continue through a narrow gap and then bear left to pass
in front of a seat on your left. Head for a map mounted on a post and turn left
on to the large track immediately in front of the post (point **B**). Follow this
track, crossing a horse ride after 200m (*ca. 2 miles*) and continuing for a
further 500m to meet a gravel road.

Cross the road diagonally and bear right along a narrower path to the left of
the road. Turn half left after a patch of brambles (50m to your left) and head
for a row of benches, passing to the right of a tee (point **C**). Swing slightly
right round the left hand corner of the Windmill enclosure and cross a track to
follow a minor path which passes the left hand corner of the Windmill car park
(point **D**). Continue in the same line over a grassy area to enter the trees on a
path at a marker post.

Follow this short, twisting path downhill. At its end (point **E**), turn left to run
down the left hand side of a large ditch with an open wooded area visible
uphill opposite to your right. Shortly after the end of this open area, cross the
ditch continuing along its right hand side. On reaching the end of the ditch
where its banks are shored up by planking (point **F**), swing right to climb a
muddy path. (*ca. 3 miles*) Where the path narrows between holly bushes and
prominent roots cross the path, fork left and then bear gently right. At the top
of the hill continue for ca. 150m straight on through the trees.
When a monument comes into view on your right, bear right to pass to its left
(point **G**). Cross a track to enter the bushes on a small path, indistinct at its
start. 

Emerge at a major junction (point **H**) and take the right hand of the two major
tracks in front of you with an open area to your right. Cross two major track
junctions close together and turn right on to a small path (point **J**) just after a
bench on your left. Turn right on to a larger yellow gravel path. In sight of the
Windmill, head for the right hand corner of the Windmill car park (*ca. 4 miles*).
Continue across the open area crossing the earlier route (point **D**). Pass to
the left of an obvious isolated bush. Follow the left hand side of the open area
to pass left of a depression and left of two silver birch trees. Continue downhill
ignoring paths to left and right and emerging at a larger track at the bottom of
the hill. Cross the track (point **K**) and take a small path straight ahead.
Follow this path as it climbs two steep, muddy inclines (The Butts), levels out
and after 200m reaches a multi-way junction (point **L**). Take the second track
on the right (passing in front of a bench) and continue downhill. At the bottom
(point **M**), bear right on to a horse ride and then immediately left to enter the
playing field (point **N**). Immediately turn left again and follow the side of the
field, initially with the circular memorial garden to your right. At the far corner
of the field (point **P**), turn right and follow the outward route to the finish which
is in the same place as the start.
