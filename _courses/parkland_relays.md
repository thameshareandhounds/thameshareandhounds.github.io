The relay start, changeover and finish is on the lower slopes of Spanker's Hill, above Robin Hood Gate and
close to Pen Ponds car park.

The course proceeds anticlockwise around Spanker's Hill, below Spankers Hill Wood and up through Treebox Wood,
Queen Mother's Copse and the White Lodge Plantations, crossing the White Lodge road just inside Duchess Wood to
join Queen's Ride just above the ditch draining Pen Ponds. Following Queen's Ride to the top, the course turns
left and left again to pass back down between the Pen Ponds, crossing the road by Pen Ponds car park 300m before
the changeover/finish.

In previous years the course passed below Lower Pen Pond; we now avoid the marshes out of sensitivity towards
rare wildlife that uses this as a habitat. As a result the <a href="{{map}}">new course</a> (4.47 km) is about
200m shorter than the <a href="{{old_map}}">old</a> (4.64 km).
