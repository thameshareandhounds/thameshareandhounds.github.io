### The Long Distance Course – Wimbledon Common

Start at the foot of the small slope near the clubhouse door and run up the
right hand edge of the field. A little before the field corner drift right through a
gap in the hedge to join a track. Immediately fork left and then fork left again
on to a smaller path with a grassy area to your right. Just before this (short)
path bends left, keep straight and cross a large track and a plank bridge into
the trees. At the first junction, fork right and follow the path around to the
right. Cross a bridge over a ditch and immediately turn right following an
indistinct path to meet a track. Cross the track, bearing slightly left.
Cross a second track after 300m and a third after a further 150m. Cross a
plank bridge and, about 100m later, fork left uphill. Emerge on to a grassy
area and turn left on to a sandy track (*ca. 1 mile*).

Take the first left downhill just before a bench on the right. Cross a stream
and turn right uphill. At the top bear right on to a major track and follow it to a
gate. Take the path to the right of the gate between a set of low posts.
Continue on this path to a second set of posts, go through them and cross a
road (point **A**). Swing right to follow a path on the left hand side of the road.
Turn left immediately after a lone tree, continuing between a tee and a road
(North View). Continue through a narrow gap and then bear left to pass in
front of a seat on your left. Head for a map mounted on a post and turn left on
to the large track immediately in front of the post (point **B**). Follow this track,
crossing a horse ride after 200m (*first pass – ca. 2 miles*) and continuing for a
further 500m to meet a gravel road.

Cross the road diagonally and bear right along a narrower path to the left of
the road (*second pass – ca. 6 miles*). Turn half left after a patch of brambles
(50m to your left) and head for a row of benches, passing to the right of a tee
(point **C**). Swing slightly right round the left hand corner of the Windmill
enclosure and cross a track to follow a minor path which passes the left hand
corner of the Windmill car park (point **D**). Continue in the same line over a
grassy area to enter the trees on a path at a marker post.

Follow this short, twisting path downhill. At its end (point **E**), turn left to run
down the left hand side of a large ditch with an open wooded area visible
uphill opposite to your right. Shortly after the end of this open area, cross the
ditch continuing along its right hand side. On reaching the end of the ditch
where its banks are shored up by planking (point **F**), swing right to climb a
muddy path (*ca. 3 miles*). Where the path narrows between holly bushes and
prominent roots cross the path, fork left and then bear gently right. At the top
of the hill continue for ca. 150m straight on through the trees.

When a monument comes into view on your right, bear right to pass to its left
(point **G**). Cross a track to enter the bushes on a small path, indistinct at its
start.

Emerge at a major junction (point **H**) and take the left hand of the two major
tracks in front of you through the trees. Continue for about 150m. Take the 
right fork to pass the edge of Kingsmere pond on your left. 150m past the
pond, bear sharp right (point **Q**) along the right hand of a pair of wide, parallel,
gravelled tracks. Cross to the left hand track when the vegetation between
them permits. Cross a major junction with another gravel track (point **R**) (*ca.
4 miles*) and continue for a further 400m.

Immediately before a stone horse trough and drinking fountain and with the
Windmill and car park visible to your right, fork left along a wide path curving
to the left and cutting the corner towards a road (Windmill Road). Maintaining
the line of this path, cross the road (point **S**) and strike out across the open
area. On reaching a horse ride running roughly parallel to Windmill Road,
turn left. Cross over another horse ride at right angles to Windmill Road and
turn right on to a path parallel to a main road (Parkside). Continue for 750m.
Immediately beyond a small fenced enclosure on your right (The Pound)
(point **T**) (*ca. 5 miles*) turn right, crossing a horse ride and joining a narrow,
indistinct path at right angles to the road and with an open area to your left.
Where path forks in front of a group of (mainly) silver birch trees, bear right.
Cross a horse ride and another parallel path. Turn right at the next path
junction. Follow the path as houses and a road corner (North View) become
visible on your left. Continue on the same path as it bends round to the right
and reach a map mounted on a post (point **B**).

Repeat the section of the course from point **B** to point **E**.

At point **E**, turn right and then almost immediately turn left up a wide path
uphill for 50m. Turn left at another wide path. After 150m pass to either side
of an island of vegetation containing an oak tree with a mis-shapen trunk and
behind it, a silver birch. Immediately after the island, turn left on to an
indistinct path in front of two straight-trunked oaks (point **U**). Emerge on to an
open area sloping downhill. Initially, head for a large beech tree directly
ahead and when about 5m short of the tree swing slightly to the right, heading
for a decaying tree trunk about 75m away, rooted in the ground, and about 1m
high. At the tree trunk take a line at right angles to the ditch and cross it (point
**V**). Climb up the small path through the trees opposite the crossing point,
ignoring path junctions, reaching a clearing at the top of the hill. Pass
between two large oak trees and leave the clearing by a path at its far righthand
corner. Descend towards the Queensmere pond for about 20m and
then turn right at the first path junction (point **W**).

Continue downhill ignoring paths to left and right and emerging at a larger
track at the bottom of the hill. Cross the track (point **K**) and take a small path
straight ahead. Follow this path as it climbs two steep, muddy inclines (The
Butts), levels out and after 200m reaches a multi-way junction (point **L**). Take
the second track on the right (passing in front of a bench) (*ca. 7 miles*) and
continue downhill. At the bottom (point **M**), bear right on to a horse ride and
then immediately left to enter the playing field (point **N**). Immediately turn left
again and follow the side of the field, initially with the circular memorial garden
to your right. At the far corner of the field (point **P**), turn right and follow the
outward route to the finish which is in the same place as the start.
