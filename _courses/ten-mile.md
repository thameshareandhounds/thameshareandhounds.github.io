### The Ten Mile Course – Richmond Park

The start is on the path that leads from the Robin Hood Gate car park to Pen
Ponds at the last tree on the right.

From the start, run up to a small enclosure and run round clockwise. As you
start back downhill, aim for the left hand end of the row of tower blocks.
Enter the line of sparse trees level with a fallen tree and go round it anticlockwise.
Join an uphill path and follow it to White Lodge (the ballet school).
Go round the buildings anti-clockwise until level with the top of Queens Ride.
Follow Queens Ride down and then up to the top.

About 50m short of the top cross to the left hand side and go straight ahead to
the side of Sidmouth Wood. Run round the enclosure anti-clockwise passing
the Ranelagh start.

Where the enclosure bears hard left, go straight on to cross a small road
heading for the right hand side of a pond. On reaching the pond, take a rough
track which bears right away from the side of the pond and heads towards the
left side of a rectangular stand of trees. Continue past the trees to the side of
the Isabella enclosure.

Run anti-clockwise round the enclosure until you reach the main path from the
Isabella car park to the enclosure. Cross this path heading for a small uphill
track just to the left of a bench. Follow this track across a flat open area
where people often fly kites and go steeply downhill and then up to the side of
Prince Charles’ Spinney.

Run over a section of horse ride and down to the flat. Fork right on to a small
path and follow it to the left hand side of a small pond.
Cross the road and head up to the main path alongside Spankers Wood. Run
along and then uphill in sparse trees. Leave the trees into the open and take
the next fork to the right.

Run down to the horse ride and turn left. Follow the horse ride across a bridge
and the run round a lone oak tree. Swing left up to the road, run round some
trees and then follow the side of the road to the Sheen Cross Junction.
After a small hump, turn left then cross the road and swing right. Look for a
track which goes over the next brow about 50m to the right of the ditch.
Follow it to the Pen Ponds.

Take the major path along the right side of the second pond and follow it until
you cross a small bridge. Take the leftmost of two right forks (i.e. not
alongside the ditch you have just crossed). Follow this path to the disabled
parking for the Isabella enclosure. Continue on a path in the same line –
there is a bench to its right but this may be moved. 

This path crosses the open and then goes into the trees, crosses a horse ride,
goes down across a muddy stream and climbs towards Thatched House
Lodge.

Go to the left of the Lodge and then head downhill to Kingston Gate. Cross
the road which runs between Robin Hood and Kingston Gates and run along
the right hand side of a ditch until close to the wall. Turn left and run
alongside the wall.

Join the gravel path and follow it to Ladderstile Gate. Continue along the
gravel path to the back of the Isabella enclosure car park. Where this path
swings to the left bear right round some fallen trees to join a smaller path
downhill alongside the wall. Run down this path to the finish near the Robin
Hood Gate.
