<p class="summary">While unable to secure medals this year Thames put in a solid showing at the Southern Championships.  </p>

            Moving the fixture to Devon, away from the usual venue of Parliament Hill, certainly reduced the number of entrants, but the quality at the front of the race was undiminished.  The course over undulating grassy fields remained resolutely free of mud throughout the day, possibly to the detriment of our team performance.  Although the senior mens event was advertised as the traditional 9 miles in practice it was disappointingly much shorter than this.<P>

After foolhardy early forays up the field the Captain found himself in a 5 man bunch sprint for 6th place.  Unleashing his usual devastating kick he predictably crossed the line in 10th.  Ben Reynolds continued his return to form in 24th, while Andy Weir rued the shortened distance as he finished strongly in 37th.  Suffering from stomach trouble Simon Wurr had a disappointing run for 85th, just ahead of Andy Thomas (89th).  Relieved to once again make the scoring team, Larry Mathews closed for us in 95th.  Mark Gilbertson and Dave Symons finished just outside the top 100.  John Cant announced his return from Australia with 128th, Matt Lynas warmed up for an ultra-race the next day in 174th, John Rye was 205th. <P>

Scoring twelve-a-side we actually won the title; but unfortunately only 6 make up a team so we placed 7th.  Matt Bryant did retain us the Oddling-Smee though, in 311th he made us the first Surrey club with 12 home.  <P>

Second claimers Louise Watson finished an excellent 3rd for Medway, and Lucy Hasell in 15th for Bristol provided a Thames presence.  Megan Clark guested for Herne Hill to finish 48th.
