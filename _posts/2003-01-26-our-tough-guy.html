            This Sunday ran in Tough Guy.  As the blurb says: "Tough guy is a unique adventure event. Its a test of physical and mental endurance based on an assault course of obstacles over 8 country miles." Actually a lot harder than I reckoned, though eminently do-able.  Sort of race that uses every trick to wear you down - from continually crossing a stream with 2m high muddy banks to "switchbacks" up and down the side of a hill.  A number of obstacles on route (6 foot walls and a lot of rough, wet and muddy underfoot areas as well as bashing through unrunnable forest) then the grand finale was the ultimate Army-style assault course for the last mile in the spectator area.  <P>

Full immersion in freezing water and lots of scramble nets and ariel rope walks.  Was neck and neck with some bloke from St Helens and only broke free in the last few hundred metres to become this years winning "Tough Guy"!!!!!  1 hour 25 mins 29 secs for 8 miles indicates how strength sapping it actually is.  Decent trophy for the mantelpiece at any rate.  And apparently on TransWorld Sport (complete with post-race interview) on Channel 4 "one Saturday in February".
