title: English National Championships, Parliament Hill
---

<p class="summary">Without a full strength team the Thames men did very well to finish 11th in the National over a sunny Parliament Hill on Saturday.  The heavy going in places seemed to suit Thames, though the mud failed to reach the Somme-like proportions of recent years. </p>



            <div class="body">
            Andy Weir had one of his best ever runs on the country to finish in 45th place.  In a superbly timed effort he surged his way through the field on the second of two laps.  Some way back the Captain stopped moaning about his knee long enough to get round in 59th.  Simon Wurr was next in 90th, veteran Andy Thomas ran well for 114th, Chris "Tough Guy" Daniels was 161st and the team was closed by Mark Gilbertson in 177th.  Dave Symons was 212th, John Cant 251st, Dave Barker (under the pseudonym of John McFarlane) 345th and Alun Johns 651st.<P>
 
Second claimers also made their presence felt.  Lucy Hasell recorded and excellent 19th running for Bristol.  Andy Beevers was 26th in the winning Leeds team, a fantastic achievement for him and his club.  After leading the Captain until the last quarter mile Matt Wakefield finished in 61st for Notts.  Phil Tedd recorded 94th for Bingley and Jeremy Bradley 309th for Blackheath.<P>
 
John Hauxwell again generously provided much appreciated showers and sustenance.
