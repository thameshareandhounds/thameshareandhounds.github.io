title: Southern 12 Stage
---

<p class="summary">Thames acquitted themselves well at the Southern 12 Stage at Milton Keynes on Sunday.  The first team qualified for the National equivalent in three weeks time by finishing 8th, while the second team moved steadily through the pack to finish 41st and 4th "B" team.  </p>

            There were plenty of sterling performances throughout the day.  Andy Thomas ran a fast time on a very competitive first leg to set us off in 19th.  His time of 25:31 represents a club vets record.  Frank Dudbridge and captain elect Dave Symons held the fort over the next two legs before Peter Woodburn gained one place on his Thames debut on leg 4.  A long leg from Chris Daniels and a fast short leg from Alex Gaskell kept us there.  The captain gained a few places on leg 7, but the result flattered him as at least two of these were due to teams not fielding a runner.  Dave Barker ran a swift and determined leg 8 before Andy Weir cemented his role as the fastest man in Thames, running a shade over 25 minutes for the next long leg.  Matt Lynas brought us into the top 10 on leg 10 with another solid run.  In unfamiliar territory by not running first, Ben Reynolds still put in a good performance on leg 11, before relay specialist Andy Lynch ran our the fastest short leg of the day to bring us home.<P>
 
It was all hands on deck to complete the second team, particular thanks to Craig Lightbody, Al Gibbons and Robin Dickson for coming on board at very short notice.  Alun Johns and Dan Pescod ran well measured races to set us on our way before Matt Jones made an encouraging Thames relay debut on leg 3.  Much in the way that Paula Radcliff will be paced by men in the London Marathon on Sunday, Al Gibbons strategically slipped into the middle of the ladies 6 stage relay to get a tow on leg 4.  The ever dependable Jerry Watson ran well on the next long leg, handing over to Al "Chemical Ali" Irvine who showed that reports of his demise are premature.  Andy Howse ran a very quick leg 7 to gain 4 places and gain much ground on the teams ahead, before Robin Dickson and Paul Whitlock did well to maintain our position.  Craig Lightbody sported an extraordinarily tight fitting vest on leg 10 while gaining two places.  Despite a lack of recent training, and hurting a calf muscle on the course, Ian Harkness repeated the feat on leg 11 (gaining two places that is, not sporting a tight vest).  <P>
