title: National 12 stage, Birmingham
---

<p class="summary">As last year, Thames finished 19th at the National 12 Stage relays at Sutton Park.  This was a fine effort given that exactly half of the team were still recovering from the London Marathon and that much of the remainder had been called up at late notice.</p>



            <div class="body">
            Ben Reynolds got us of to a blinding start by placing 17th in the opening rush.  His exertions at the marathon clearly didnt hinder him as he recorded a time only a few seconds off his best.  With other clubs running their stronger legs early we slipped back a few places as Rob Bowyer, Andy Thomas and Jerry Watson followed, until Andy Weir brought us back to 24th on stage 5.  From there we inched forward with a short legs from John McFarlane and Andy Howse, and a long one from the Captain, before Andy Lynch took us to our peak position of 16th.  Dave Barker did well to keep us there, while Matt Lynas and Ian Harkness held on to bring us home.
