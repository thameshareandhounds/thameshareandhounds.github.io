            Andy Weir (41:17) led Nick Altmann (42:07) and Larry Mathews (42:44) to a Thames’ 1-2-3 and in doing so secured the Road Running Championship.  Chris Daniels (44:27), Andy Howse (44:31) and Dave Symons (44:39) took positions four to six as Thames dominated the team event.  Keith Spacie (M65) was the next saltire to cross the line in 50:07 which was sufficient to defeat all M50’s, and Kate Symons took the women’s race with 52:18.  However, these exploits were shaded by Anthony Eady who pull off the remarkable coup of winning the handicap for the second consecutive year with a ‘Haile’ impressive net time of 35:30.
