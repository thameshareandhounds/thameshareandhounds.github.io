<p class="summary">Nick Altmann extended the reach of the Saltire for 7th place in Mexico on Sunday.  </p>



            <div class="body">
            Nick is pleased to report that the race was very similar to home road races - similar age and ability, inadequate toilets at the start and an interminable presentation ceremony.
