<p class="summary">Elsewhere Nick Talbot, running for Nottingham, "won" the Midlands.  Despite actually crossing the line in second he was awarded the title as the victor did not qualify for the prize.  Congratulations to Nick for this tremendous performance.  Matt Wakefield, also running for Notts, finished 22nd in the same race.</p>
