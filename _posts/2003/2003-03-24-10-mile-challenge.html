            For many the greatest challenge was navigational as few were prepared to admit to any knowledge of the course.  The Captain led the pack on a route best described as a run around Richmond Park encompassing some of the main features of the 10 mile course.  Behind him, showing reluctance to be associated in any way with orienteering, Larry Mathews followed home without the benefit of a map.  Andy Lynch and John McFarlane occupied third and fourth spot until a late dash saw them finish first, but only by mistakenly omitting the last mile and a half.  Elsewhere there were good runs from Simon Leathes and Kate McDonald to take second and third places in the handicap, but John Bryant pipped them to take the title.
