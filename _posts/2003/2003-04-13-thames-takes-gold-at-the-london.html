title: "Thames Takes Gold at the London Marathon"
---

<p class="summary">Thames produced an excellent performance at the London Marathon.  A bumper turnout of twenty runners was crowned by victory for the team in the AAA championships.  </p>



            <div class="body">
            Thanks to the many spectators who lent much needed support to the competitors all the way round the course, some finding the athleticism and logistical skills to cheer us at four separate vantage points.<P>

Andy Weir and Ben Reynolds set off together, before checking their slightly optimistic pace to allow the Captain to join them at around 8 miles.  With the trio sitting comfortably in a largish pack, and three to score in the team, things were already looking good for our championship challenge.  From halfway Ben started to steadily but not dramatically lose ground.  Meanwhile the Captain continued to operate in an ungallant, some might say round-headed, manner by steadfastly sitting at the back of the pack while Andy and the rest of the pack took the brunt of the wind.  Stepping out of the slipstream just before Tower Bridge he finished in 2:24:10 to carve a single second off his previous best, a skill that Paula Radcliffe would do well to develop if she wants further pay days like Sunday.  Andy survived a difficult closing couple of miles to dip under 2:25 for the first time.  Ben completed the set of personal bests in 2:26:46 to close the team.  <P>
 
Our expected rivals for gold medals were Leeds City, ironically including Thames second claimer Andy Beevers.  After a solid first half his and his team challenge faded as digestive difficulties slowed his progress thereafter.  This allowed Matt Lynas to come home as next man in 2:34:51, a good run from someone treating it as "speedwork" for forthcoming ultra races.  Andy Lynch was home under two minutes later, another to find the second half tough going, as was Alex "blown a gasket" Gaskell who was disappointed with a debut outside 2:50.  <P>
 
Ahead of him came Duncan Clark in 2:42, running for Handy Cross, who has dealt well with a recent lack of training and sleep due to the birth of his first child Fraser.  Congratulations to Duncan and Sarah on his arrival.  Jerry Watson was first Thames vet home behind him well inside 2:45, while Bill Snelgrove continued his campaign for the "First Man in Tights" to be recognised as an official category, just outside 2:50.  Paul Whitlock and Alun Johns both set off at around 3 hours pace, but found the second half to be deceptively longer than the first by about 15 minutes.  <P>
 
Unfortunately Wendy Petty was unable to finish due to the recurrence of a hip injury.  Congratulations to Andy Johnson, Colin Price, Alastair Caisley, Simon Leathes, Jeffery Gordon and John Bryant who all completed the course in conditions that become uncomfortably warmer throughout the day.  The last word should go to Jan Hildreth who once again finished to maintain his ever-present record into a 23rd year.<P>
