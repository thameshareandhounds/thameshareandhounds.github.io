            <div class="body">
            Three elderly members went an astonishing distance  (that is, before they started running) to the west coast of Scotland to run in the Vet National X Country Champs.
 
Due entirely to the President coming and running with consummate placing skill learnt over several decades of campaigning, we managed to get second place in the team placing, scoring 202 to Invicta 204 pts.  Bingley are astonishingly strong in the V60 category at present - they had 4 home before our first and scored 128 pts.  You might have thought that we would get a silver medal for this, but alas we were in Scotland ......Placings for the team events took into account all runners over 50.

Peter Honnibal  	8th	44.57
Michael Johnson	11th	45.32
El Presidente   	17th	55.28
