            Dave and Kate Symons celebrated that start of their marriage at the Two Oceans marathon in South Africa.  Dave recorded 3:43:20 for the 56k race, while Kate produced 1:43:40 for the accompanying half marathon.  New member Nick Malynn also embarked on this gruelling challenge (the race that is, not marriage) with 4:02:45 for the longer version.
