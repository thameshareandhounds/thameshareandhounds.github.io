title: "Fastest man in Merton"
---

<p class="summary">Anyone inspecting the club notice board recently will have had their attention drawn an article on the Barry Jones 10k.  Its there because modest John McFarlane was crowned the "fastest man in Merton" for finishing second in 34:18.  Lucy Hasell received no similar accolade but she did win the womens race in 36:55.  Al Gibbons recorded 41:10 for 30th</p>
