title: "V60s take Silver at the Vets Relays, Sutton Park"

<p class="summary">The V60s took silver and the V40s a creditable top 50% ranking in Birmingham.  Commentary from Bill ...</p>



            <div class="body">
            The over 40s squad managed a highly commendable performance up at showery blustery Sutton Park on Saturday, finishing 29th out of the 58 teams that completed (several didnt).  Our star man, of course, was Andy Thomas - finally uninjured for this fixture at the 3rd attempt - who made up 27 places on leg 2 in running an "official" 15:08 (but probably more like 15:04) which is right up there with the fastest ever Thames vet times on this course. 
 
Because it was a combined 40s and 50s team, with a little help from the 60s, the average age was a tad over 49 so we were probably conceding a good few years to winners Ronhill Cambuslang who were a mere 16:40 down the road.  
 
The over 60s won silver medals behind Bingley and a long way ahead of Blackheath. Peter Honniball brought the saltire through in the lead after leg one which must have been quite a battle as the leading three 60s teams were within 3 seconds. Keith Spacie and Michael Johnson both also ran very solid legs but Bingley just had a couple of faster men in the locker. Well done chaps.
