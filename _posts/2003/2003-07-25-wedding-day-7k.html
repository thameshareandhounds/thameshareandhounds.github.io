            Thames turned up in force to retain the Stag Trophy at the Wedding Day 7km in Bushey Park.  Andy Weir ran a well paced 22:53 to take 7th place, one ahead of Sonia Oâ€™Sullivan (23:02).  John McFarlane continued his comeback, taking 9th place in 23:16, ahead of Dave Symons and Andy Howse.  Tim Nightingale broke into the top 50 and it was good to see Leslie Cherrington back racing again to take the fourth M40 place.  Robin Dickson  was fastest M60 in 110th place out of a field of 600-plus runners.
