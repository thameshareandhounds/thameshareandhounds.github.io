title: "Blair Fish wins in style"
---

<p class="summary">An excellent turn out of 51 runners on Saturday saw Peter Blair-Fish romp to victory in the handicap ahead of Ben Brown and Alan Gibbons.  In quick conditions many members performed well, and particularly well done to Lucy Hassell whose time of 29.45 is a ladies course record.  <P>

In the mens race Phil Sly and Nick Altmann battled it out at the front - Nick having to stay in touch with Phil to keep him on course.</p>
