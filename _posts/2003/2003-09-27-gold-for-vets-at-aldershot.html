            Thames vets won gold medals at the Southern relays by a full five minutes.  Keith Spacie started them off in second place, a position that Jeremy Denny held on the next leg.  Robin Dickson swept into the lead before handing over to Michael Johnson to complete the victory.  Nearest challengers Barnet were disqualified for running the same man twice.<P>

The vet 40s were 31st and the vet 50s finished 11th.  <P>

The senior team moved into the lead on the second leg thanks to new signing Phill Sly. They slipped back to finish 6th behind the winning Belgrave team that included Thames second claim member Will Cockerell on leg 5.
