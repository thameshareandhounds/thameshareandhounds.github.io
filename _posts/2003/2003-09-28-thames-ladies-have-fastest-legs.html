---

<p class="summary">Sonia O'Sullivan and Benita Johnson ran the fastest legs of the day at the Ladies Southern relays.</p>



            <div class="body">
            Sonia recorded the fastest official time of the day to propel the Thames A team to 10th spot.  She was backed up by Kate Symons, Sarah Bentley and Rachael Thompson.<P>

New signing Benita Johnson ran even faster, though eligibility requirements meant she competed for the B team.  Her official time of 11:43 would have clipped one second off the previous course record, held by none other than Paula Radcliffe.
