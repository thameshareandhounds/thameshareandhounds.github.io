            The lure of a local race (and a famous tea?) saw Thames field 21 runners for a comprehensive victory over Kingston & Poly, Bank and Milos on Saturday.  Chris Daniels made a welcome return at the sharp end while several close battles were fought between Dan Pescod/Richard Hignett/Leslie Cherrington - Al Gibbons/Peter Blair Fish and Jeff Armitage/Michael Bostellman.<P>
