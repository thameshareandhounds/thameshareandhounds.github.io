<p class="summary">Dorchie Lee made a welcome return for Thames to lift the ladies up the table.  <p>
In the mens race, a strong showing by Herne Hill means that the race for the title is now wide open.  John McFarlane and Andy Weir produced excellent runs at the sharp end, while inspired performances by Al Kennis, Andy Howse and Alex Gaskell ensured that we still closed in a low scoring 216 points.  However, with little to separate HHH and Thames, members will know that the final race on 7 February will be a tough fixture.  Results below</p>
