title: Surrey League, Coulsden
---

<p class="summary">Thames travelled to Coulsden with the prospect of our close rivals, Herne Hill fighting to lift the trophy in the final match.  But excellent runs from the team - from Martin Shore and Ben Reynolds in 9th and 10th to the evergreen Ian Harkness who closed the team in 40th position - meant that the match was won, and a successful defence of the Surrey League title.  Thames results below, and well done to all.
