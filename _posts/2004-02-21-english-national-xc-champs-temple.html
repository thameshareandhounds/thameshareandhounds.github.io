title: English National XC Champs - Temple Newsham
---

<p class="summary">Ben Reynolds secured the highest placing for a Thames man at the English National in over ten years.  Solid running behind by Simon Wurr and Andy Weir provided a good platform for the team - completed by the rejuvenated Mark Gilbertson, Al Kennis and then the Captain.  Good support by Matt Lynas, Nick Malynn and Jerry Watson meant we climbed the table for the nine to score.  In the ladies, both Lucy Hasell and Dorchie Lea ran excellently for 24th and 46th places.
