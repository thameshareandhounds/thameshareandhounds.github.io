---

<p class="summary">Thames swept aside the challenge from Kingston & Poly over 9 country miles in Richmond Park last. On a fast, dry course Matt Lynas led the saltires home in 2nd place and for the second time in recent weeks gave his finishing sprint a good testing, just being pipped for the lead spot. </p>
