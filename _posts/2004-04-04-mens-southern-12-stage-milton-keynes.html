title: Mens Southern 12 Stage Milton Keynes
---

<p class="summary">Thames finished an excellent 4th in the 12 stage relays on Sunday.  The team ran strongly throughout, but there  particularly good runs from all of the long leg runners and also Andy Lynch and Larry Matthews on the short legs.  The B team finished a creditable 35th, not at all due to noteworthy tactics from James - Ill start my leg 15 seconds early - Bogue which helped to lift us up the table.  Full results and leg by leg placings below</p>
