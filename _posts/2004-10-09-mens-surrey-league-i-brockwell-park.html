            <i>John McFarlane takes up the story...</i><p>
2.45pm and the vice captain’s motivational emails had worked well, almost the entire first team was assembled and fit, (the only exception being our Aussie import, on European vacation), even Tim Beer was there looking disorientated and exhausted after a few hundred metres of strides.<p>
The first lap saw Nick and myself tucking into the lead group, no one was willing to take the pace on a blustery day, and Nick bravely charged to the front, Steve Sharp was not having any of that, and at the end of the first lap put the boot in and the group was soon stretched to single file. I had no response to Nick’s aggressive start, and the deceptively hilly,  short course was not to my liking, as he lengthened his lead on me, then things got worse as Belgrave’s Nash came past both of us. Dave Anderson, Bel’s GB x-country international showed he’s back to fitness, and effortlessly pulled away from Steve Sharp to take the win, with three Bels finishing in the top four things were not looking good, then came Nick, an excellent 5th in a very quick sub 23 mins, showing he’s getting back to his early year form that saw him run a 14.08 5km four months ago, I was 9th then came our new second claim summer signing Ewan Malloch, proving he is going to be a very welcome asset to the first team squad, and behind him some excellent packing with Andy W, Harkers and Si Wurr, 19, 20, 21, perhaps somewhat disappointing for the hard training marathon man Harkers,  but there will be no hills next Sunday at Abingdon Marathon. The captain was 27th closely followed by our first vet Ben, Alex making the trip down from Bath very worthwhile 8th scorer in 35th and another new signing Tim closing the team in a creditable 38th in his first Thames outing.<p>
Back to race fitness Al kennis and then Mark G were just outside the scoring ten, then  Lazza and Tim were left to bring up the rear, battling it out with the first vet 55, less beer more miles required I think boys.<p>
Bels beat us by 38 points on the day, but as their manager pointed out they will struggle to get such a strong team out for the other fixtures, especially their home race, and there is every probability, maintaining that sort of turn out, that we will break the trend of only winning the league after winning the first fixture.
