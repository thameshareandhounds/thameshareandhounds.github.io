title: Match v Hercules Wimbledon
---

<p class="summary">Thames played hosts to our across the Common rivals over the 5 mile course.  Our 16 runners performed creditably, particularly Nic Gould who came in second and also Gavin Yeats who was making his debut in Thames colours.  Sadly, however, the Hercules upper order was too strong and we went down by 89 points to 125.  Full results below.</p>
