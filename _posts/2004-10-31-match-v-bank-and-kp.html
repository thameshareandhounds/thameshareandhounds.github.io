title: Match v Bank and K&P
---

<p class="summary">A fine group of 25 or so Thames members raced against BoE and K&P in the Park on Saturday.  We ran out comprehensive winners, and Claire Sylvester ran particularly well as also did Andy Weir who completed a five mile pace run before the race after he picked up a flat tyre en route.  Top results, courtesy of BoE below.</p>
