title: Ranelagh Mob Match
---

<p class="summary">The captain knew the omens were good when he had to ask for more numbers from the organisers before the start.  And so it proved with a splendid turnout of 56 members who secured an excellent victory by 1810 points to 3076 in a 49 to score event.  There were many fine performances throughout the field but particular mention should go to Simon Wurr and Matt Jones who ran storming races at the sharp end, and to Tom Samuel who ran splendidly as a junior.  It was also particularly good to see Andy Thomas back running again and also to welcome Tim Low back into a saltire.  Results below.</p>
