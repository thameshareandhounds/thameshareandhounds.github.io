title: "Megan Storms the Sunny Southerns"

<p class="summary">Thirteen saltires raced a benign Parliament Hill course on Saturday.  In beautiful running conditions, Megan Clark ran the race of the day, with a splendid 13th place, anchoring the Thames ladies to a solid team performance.  In the mens race Ian Harkness retired hurt after a couple of laps, but goaded Andy Weir into a last gasp effort to pip Ben Reynolds for our first man home.  With solid runs also from Simon Wurr, Mark Gilbertson and Al Kennis, the Captain closed the team for sixth position overall.  Results below</p>
