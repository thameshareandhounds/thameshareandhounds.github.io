<p class="summary">Andy Weir won the long race but John McFarlane worked out a way of giving the competitors a 15 minute start just after control 1.  He then managed to catch everyone but Andy including impressing the 3rd and 4th finishers by the rate he passed them just before the finish.  Mike Farmery won the middle distance race and Chris Robinson was 2nd woman in the "sprint" event.</p>
