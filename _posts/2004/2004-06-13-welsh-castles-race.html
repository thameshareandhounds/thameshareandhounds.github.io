title: "Welsh Castles Race"
---

<p class="summary">Thames fielded 40 runners for an excellent, and successful, weekend at the Welsh Castles.  The veterans team performed well, and the senior team won the overall title by 22 minutes from Les Croupiers - only the second time the overall title has left Wales as well as the King of the Mountains title.  In a weekend of excellent performances alround, particular note must go to Nick Altmann who came back from the dead to win his leg and also John McFarlane who had a fine, nay great, run considering his previous days exertions.  Many thanks to Peter Blair-Fish and, to all who helped with the logistics throughout the weekend and also the veterans team for allowing the seniors to swap in two runners on their respective legs.
