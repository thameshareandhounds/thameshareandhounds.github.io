<p class="summary">Allie Outram announced her return to running with a fine victory, while Andy Weir - on course to record his hat trick of overall wins - was cruelly denied as he went off course with 500m to go.  Both men and women were successful in the team prize - with the ladies proud to close their team before the men.  Congratulations also to the ladies captain who took the Quentin Clough Handicap, ahead of Naomi and Keith.  Thames results below</p>
