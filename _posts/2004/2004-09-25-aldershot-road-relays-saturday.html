<p class="summary">The V60 team once again stole the show with a fine team victory.  Good running by Michael Johnson and Robin Dickson saw the team off well before Keith Spacie burst into the lead on the third leg.  Peter Giles then closed the team - with time to wave at the tent - and recorded the second fastest time of the day.<PRE>
</PRE>John McFarlane put in the performance of the day in the senior event, with seventh fastest overall.  With three good teams running we made sure of national qualification by a solid 9th place.  The B team finished first second team in the event and 16th place would, itself, also have qualified for Sutton Park if this was allowed.  Results below.</p>
