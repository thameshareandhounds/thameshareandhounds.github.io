<p class="summary">Chris Chataway ran his first 5000m in 48 years at Kingsmeadow on Wednesday.  With Henk Altmann playing the Kuts card for the first ten laps the years were rolled back as Thames celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 5k world record.  Sadly noone could get close to 13.51.6 but Paul Newby and Di Leaky won the two races on the night.  Results below.</p>
