<p class="summary">With the top order depleted by international duty, Thames finished a mid-order 38th out of 63 teams on Saturday.  Best by almost a minute was John McFarlane, but Mark Gilbertson also demonstrated a fine return to form while Al Kennis gave his achilles a good testing on the anchor leg.  Results below.</p>
