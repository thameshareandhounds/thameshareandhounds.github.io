title: "Gold and Silver in the Thames"
---

<p class="summary">It was a gold and silver afternoon for Thames in the South of the Thames 5 miles in Richmond Park.  In the women, Allie Outram won individual gold and led our scoring team of Kate Symons, Alison Carpenter and new girl Nicola Don to team gold.  In the men, Matt Jones, Simon Wurr and Andy Weir all ran excellently as we were just pipped into Silver for the team by Kent AC in both the four and eight to score.  </p>
