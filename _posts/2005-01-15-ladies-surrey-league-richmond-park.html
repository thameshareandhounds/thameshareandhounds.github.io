title: Ladies Surrey League - Richmond Park
---

<p class="summary">Thames ladies were led home by fine runs from both Dorchie (3) and Rachel (6) in a fast and furious outing over the Ranelagh home course.  Nicola Don made her league debut helping the team to place fourth, enough to retain third spot in the league.  Ranelagh and Bels look set to fight it out for first and second place in the last match and we will need to rise to the challenge to hold off any last minute threat for third place from our friends at SLH.  Thames results below.</p>
