title: Mens Surrey League - Wimbledon Common
---

<p class="summary">A top notch performance by the Thames men brought a second victory of the season, and means we go into the final fixture with a lead of 240 points over Bels.  Nick Altmann and Ewen Malloch led from the front while Harkers put in a characteristically strong run for seventh spot.  Then with excellent packing we put seven saltires in nine places from 16th to 24th â€“ closing in a low 155 points.  In addition to the top slots, Matt Jones demonstrated the immediate benefits of professional studentship, Andy Weir put in a particularly gut wrenching performance and it was good to welcome Simon Baines, James Caudwell and Hugh Shields who were all making their Thames debuts.
