<p class="summary">Thames turned out one of its strongest teams to take the silver medals at Parliament Hill on Saturday.  With Al Hart pulling on new spikes for the race and Nick Altmann resting up for the week we were destined for a sparkling performance.  As Johnny and Nick led the charge up the hill, the battle was on for the minor places.  Andy, Ben and Ian tussled it out while Al Hart shook off Simon W over the last lap to close the six to score team.  Nic Gould crowned a successful afternoon by finishing our twelfth runner in a low 185th position to lift the Odling-Smee trophy.  In the ladies, second claim Thames member, Julia Bleasdale was a fine winner while Alison Carpenter ran well for a top 100 placing.  Thames results below.</p>
