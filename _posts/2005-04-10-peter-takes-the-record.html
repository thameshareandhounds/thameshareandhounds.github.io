title: Peter takes the record
---

<p class="summary">With many of the seniors opting to rest their racing shoes in preparation for next weekend the Thames veterans stole the show at the Wimbledon 10km.  Richard Pitt led Thames home to win first V50, Peter Giles broke the V60 course record (previously held by one Keith Spacie) followed home by Robin Dickson and Anthony Eady.  Just behind Robin, Anna Garnier ran a pb for first W50 by a considerable margin.  Seniors Dan Pescod and the ladies captain also ran well over the hilly course and congratulations to Dans partner Isabelle who ran a debut 10km accompanied by Peterâ€™s partner Yasmin.</p>
