<p class="summary">The sun shone - just - for the annual Parkland Relays.  Seven teams from Thames were joined by a fine turnout of both mens and ladies teams from Thames Turbo, Westminster School, Wimbledon Windmilers, Guildford & Goldaming, Sheen Shufflers, Holme Run and Tadworth.  Thames supplied the first mens team home with John Mcfarlane running the fastest leg of the day.  Guilford and Goldaming placed third team overall and fastest vets. Windmilers ladies were victorious in the ladies match with Tash Buckley taking the fastest ladies leg in 17.33.  Thanks to Al Kennis for organising the race, to Wendy and Anthony for assisting with timekeeping and to assorted Thames members for flagging the course.</p>
