<p class="summary">Thames celebrated the vice captains veteran debut with a weekend jaunt to Ghent.  Putting his strategic planning into action, Larry saw the team to the entry desk with a full five minutes to spare.  In the race itself, Don Naylor took second and Dorchie Lee an unofficial third place.  Deeper in the field, however, the exertions of the previous nights GBG training took their toll.  Results below.</p>
