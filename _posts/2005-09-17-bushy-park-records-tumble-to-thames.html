title: Bushy Park Records Tumble to Thames
---

<p class="summary">Phill Sly set a course record of 14.54 in this weeks running of the Bushy Park 5km time trial.  Anyone keen to try to match Phills record or Sonias ladies record of 16.22 for that matter should give this popular and laid back race a try.  It takes place every Saturday morning at 9am at the Diana Fountain Bushy Park.</p>
