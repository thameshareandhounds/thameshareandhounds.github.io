title: Stretton Skyline
---

<p class="summary">A strong Thames team tacked the 18 mile Stretton Skyline fell race and came away with the team title. With five vicious hills and 4500 foot of ascent it was not for the faint hearted, and David Symons had an outstanding run to come 3rd in 2h 30:37 only 4 minutes off the lead. Simon Wurr (5th) and Andy Howse (6th) rounded off the team. Ice-climber Martin Boulton showed his versatility with a 3h 47 clocking.</p>
