title: Matt Jones hits the jackpot
---

<p class="summary">Fresh after his victory in the Short Distant Challenge and then a PB in the Windsor half Matt made it three weeks to remember with a runaway victory in the annual inter-club match against Kingston & Poly. In the team stakes Thames made it a cleansweep in the 5 10 and 20-to-score team events.</p>



            <div class="body">
            A terrific turnout of 20 TH&H runners beat K&P in what was a terrifically well-organised and marshalled route. Behind Matts storming run, Nic Gould yet again showed what big strides he has made and it was terrific to see Andy Ward and ALG don the saltire again. A special mention too to David Symons for racing for the second time inside 5 hours and for Anna Jones who braved the vile early conditions and finished with a terrific flourish.
