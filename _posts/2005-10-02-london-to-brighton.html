<p class="summary">Matt Lynas finished a magnificent 3rd in the annual London to Brighton race in 6 hrs 8 minutes. Matt held onto second until the 35 mile mark at which point three time winner Brian Hennessy passed him and gained a few minutes lead before Matt unleashed a "sprint finish" and cut the deficit to a mere 8 seconds.</p>
