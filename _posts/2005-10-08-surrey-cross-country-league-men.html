title: Surrey Cross Country League - Men

<p class="summary">Against a very strong Herne Hill outfit, Thames put in a terrific performance with several runners surging through the field. John McFarlane led the way in 4th with Phill Tedd (travelling down from Oxford) a very encouraging 5th. Strong runs from Ian Harkness (11th), the Captain (17th), Darren Talbot (18th) and David Symons (24th) were also backed up by some close packing in the 30s. Nic Gould put in his best performance in a Thames vest with a magnificent 31st place. Full and official results to follow but it would seem that HHH won with 181 pts, THH second with 209 pts and Bels third with 296 pts. The next match is on Sat 19th Nov - we need to make the next three matches a priority if we are to challenge HHH and defend the title.</p>
