<p class="summary">David Symons and the Captain slugged it out over 20k of undulating bog, tracks and paths in the Mendips along with 200 other runners. Simon just had the edge at the end with a clear gap of 4 minutes to third. GB rowing coach Nick Maloney, who made his first THH training run four days before, was a superb 19th. As the race sponsors were Yeo-valley foods it was yoghurt all round to the winning team.</p>
