<p class="summary">The mens team finished 24th out of 76 teams in the annual six stage relay fest at Sutton Park. </p>



            <div class="body">
            John McFarlane led the team home with a more than solid run in 16th on leg one and our fastest of the day in 17.56 before Ian Harkness excelled on the second leg which showed that he is getting back to top form. Andy Weir found the going quite hard on leg three before Nic Gould and David Symons put in stirling performances to bring Thames back into the top 30. The Captain then moved Thames up to 24th with a run as solid as the Icelandic food he had been eating all week.
