title: Hereward Relay
---

<p class="summary">A hastily-assembled team of four finished 11th out of 126 teams in this popular 38 mile relay from Peterborough to Ely. Michael Johnsons team talk clearly had the desired effect as his charges skipped across the Fenland landscape like a pack of gazelles.</p>



            <div class="body">
            Michael Johnson led the THH challenge with a gutsy run on leg one, before Anna Garnier sped across the longest leg of the day. The Captain pulled Thames through the field and in doing so clocked the fastest time on stage three, before late call-up Frank Dudbridge took Thames into the top ten on the final slog from Welney to Ely. Thanks are extended to Veronica Richards for her chauffeur service, support and post-race fruit juice.
