title: Nine miles and carols
---

<p class="summary">Wednesday night saw the revival of a much talked of Thames tradition.  It wasnt quite nine miles and we were wise enough to stop short of nine carols! Many thanks to Alison, Darren, Doug, Al and Andy (and their families) for their hospitality and for letting us sing on their doorsteps.</p>
