title: "Mens Surrey League, Coulsden"
---

<p class="summary">It was a low key finish to the Surrey League on Saturday.  And just as well, since as the captain went for his warm up we only had eight confirmed runners.  But then Al Kennis pulled on his trainers, and the cavalry of Alun Johns and Al Irvine ensured we would close a team.  Chris Daniels also ran, but as ultimate anchor, gave the field a 5 minute start (and Robin the chance to practice his baby-minding skills).  <P>
In the race itself, Phil Tedd led us home, before Ben got the better of Andy W and Ian in a rematch from the Southern.  Sam Aldridge made a fine debut ahead of Simon while the captain gave his Belgrave opposite number a crumb of comfort as the man in maroon finished ahead for the first time this year.  And then who was it to be?  Andy Howse had made the trip up from the south coast and ran well while Al Kennis and Alun Johns closed the team, with Al Irvine as a valuable backstop.  We won the match and retained the league by 489 points.  A great achievement for Thames and well done to all who turned out over the four fixtures.  Men of the match?  Ben for wrapping up the overall vets title and Alun for his scoring performance.  But Alun - no going into retirement yet, we might need you next season!  Results as they come below.</p>
