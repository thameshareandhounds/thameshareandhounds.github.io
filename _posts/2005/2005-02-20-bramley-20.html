<p class="summary">John McFarlane put in a strong start to his London Marathon build up, winning with a very useful 1hr.44.12. Toby Sykes also ran well for 2.12.25,</p>



            <div class="body">
            Getting to the half way mark in 51.35 on a snowy, blustery day, the course record was on.  Steadying up somewhat into a good rythmn thereafter, and hanging on for the hilly last couple of miles, John was able to record not only a 2 1/2 minute pb, but also took the course record by 30 seconds from local rival Huw Lobb.
