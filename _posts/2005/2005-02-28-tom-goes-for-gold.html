<p class="summary">Good luck to Tom Samuel who is running for Kent AAA in the U17 Inter County XC this weekend as well as for London Schools in the English School Championships. Tom was also 8th in the National Tetrathlon in Bath last weekend in which he only narrowly missed the target required to attain Lottery funding. </p>
