title: "Nike 12 Stage relays - Milton Keynes"

<p class="summary">John McFarlane rewrote the Thames all-time rankings as the A team closed 4th overall and the B team third 2nd team.  Nick Altmann led us off with an excellent 24.31, which was well held by Andies Howse and Weir.  Matt Jones ran a solid fourth leg before Johnny lifted us up to third with 24.01.  Inspired by a tumble on the gravel, Andy Lynch then lifted us into the lead at the end of the sixth stage - a position the captain held all too briefly.  Al Kennis settled us into our closing position of fourth on the eigth leg and Simons Baines and Wurr, Alex Gaskell and Nic Gould held their concentration to all run well as large gaps opened in front and behind.  In the B team, Gavin Yeats ran particularly well after a late promotion from 10th to second leg while Chris Daniels and Larry Matthews showed hints of a return to form with good early legs.  In the ladies race, Kate Pippa Symons ran round well for 21.29. Thames results below with full details at http://mcs.open.ac.uk/mkac/05seaaheader.htm</p>
