<p class="summary">Thames took advantage of golden London weather to record a clutch of excellent times.
<br>
Despite a disappointing run by his high standards, John McFarlane was the first thames man home just under 2:21.  Behind him a tight battle for the remaining team places was settled in the last mile as Ian Harkness and Andy Weir swept past a dramatically slowing Nick Altmann on their way to personal bests.  Behind them personal bests were also secured by the captain, Al Hart and Simon Baines, while it was a great marathon debut for Matt Jones as he snuck home in 2.39.57. Preliminary indications are that Johnny, Ian and Andy led Thames to a hat trick of victories in the team prize and also retained the AAA and Southern trophies. 
<br>
In the ladies, Benita led Sonia home, both clocking sub 2.30, with Nicola completing the Thames team a little further down the field. 
<br>
Congratulations too for Jan Hildreth and Jeffrey Gordon on maintaining their ever-present status into the 25th running of the event.  Second-claim Chris Finill managed the same feat, despite only recently competing in a 100km race, and still managed to record a superlative 2.53.45.
<br>
Second claimer Lucy Hasell also excelled herself in the womens elite field with a time of 2.39.20 - a PB, 7th Briton and 16th overall.
