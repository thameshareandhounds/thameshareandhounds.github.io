title: "Greenbelt Relay"
---

<p class="summary">Thames withstood a battering from the wind and rain to secure "King of the Mountains", 8th overall and second mixed team in the two day Greenbelt relay. With each runner running on both Saturday and Sunday Matt Jones, Nic Gould and the mens captain shared five stage wins and a course record between them and the ladies captain ran well to take her stage on Saturday. Dave Walsh, Jeremy Denny, Chris Hutber, Anthony Hickson and Tim Low completed the Thames team with logistical support from several Thames wives overseen by Peter Blair-Fish. Other Thames members in action for rival teams included Sonia OSullivan, Richard Pitt, Peter Giles and Ian Trotter in the Millennium team and Tim Beer and Johnny Powell in the Stock Exchange team.
