<p class="summary">Thames retained the Welsh Castles trophy at the weekend.  Al Kennis and Chris Daniels saw us off well from Caernarfon before Andy Weir provided a sound start to our Mountains campaign with third on leg 3.  Al Irvine and Chris Hutbur consolidated the team, before Harkers ran the leg of the day from Dolgellau to Dinas Mawddwy with a 4 minute victory on leg 7.  Bill Snelgrove made a late appearance in the team to clock 7th spot before a solid leg from Matt Bryant on leg 9.  Lazza ran a typically awe-inspiring leg 10 for second spot.  With the usual late night delights of Newtown unavailable this year, the team was raring to go on Sunday.  The captain clocked 3rd on leg 11.  Then 4th from Nick Malynn and 3rd from Ed Catmur on leg 13 saw us begin move up the leaderboard.  Top spot was gained after an inspired run by Phill Sly on the Drovers leg, taking the course record and a six minute victory.  Nic Gould saw us well into Brecon before Simon secured the King of the Mountains title with a fine victory on leg 16.  John Cant, Mark Gilbertson and Matt Lynas all secured podium finishes before Rhodri anchored the team in Cardiff for a 12 minute victory over resurgent Wirral and Bridgend.
