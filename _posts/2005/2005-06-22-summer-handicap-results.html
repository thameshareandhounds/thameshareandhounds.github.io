            <div class="body">
            There were also very strong performances from Richard Pitt and Al Gibbons. Congratulations to Ben Reynolds on recording the fastest time of the night immediately prior to starting a new job in the US. Ben has been a star member of TH&H for many years and we will miss his storming runs in the Surrey league, Southerns, National and all road relays. Many thanks to the handicappers who yet again produced a superb event.
