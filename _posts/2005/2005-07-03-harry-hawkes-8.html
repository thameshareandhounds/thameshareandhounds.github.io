<p class="summary">Thames men secured an impressive clean sweep of the prizes. Richard Turner, Bill Snelgrove and Jeremy Denny each won their respective age categories and Phill Sly won the race with a sub 40-minute course record leading home John Macfarlane, Andy Weir and Matt Jones to take first team.  Was this fine display of running a result of the financial incentives offered by the race organiser or the promise of homemade fruitcake at the post race tea?  Not to be outdone Alison Carpenter was fourth lady and first v45 with Alison, Kate and new faces Kay and Melissa taking second ladies team.  The real race, of course, was for the Quentin Clough handicap won by Richard Turner with Frank Carpenter hot on his virtual heels in second place.  Many thanks to Jeremy for stirling work yet again as handicapper.</p>
