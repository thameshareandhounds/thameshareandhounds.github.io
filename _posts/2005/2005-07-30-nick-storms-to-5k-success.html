title: "Nick storms to 5k success"
---

<p class="summary">Nick Altmann won a 5k race in Bedford and in doing so demolished two GB internationals. With a final 400 metre surge of 60 seconds, Nick flew past World Championship-bound Huw Lobb and also left AAAs 10,000 metre champion Gavin Thompson in his wake. This form is very encouraging as Nick (and a number of other club members) build towards the Berlin marathon in late September.</p>
