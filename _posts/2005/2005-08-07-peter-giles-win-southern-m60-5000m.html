title: "Peter Giles win Southern M60 5000m Championships"

<p class="summary">Peter Giles continued his dominance of the M60 age group at 5000 metres with another commanding performance at a hot and windy Exeter. His solo win in the South of England Championships in a time of 18:15 was all the more impressive given the fact that he strained his calf on the final lap. </p>
