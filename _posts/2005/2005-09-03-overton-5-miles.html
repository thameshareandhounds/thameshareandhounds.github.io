<p class="summary">Matt Jones and David Symons were in sparkling form at the Overton 5, a high quality event that attracted a large and strong field. Both Thamesmen lead the charge at the start and returned with fine times over a challenging circuit, all of which bodes well for their half marathons this month. Keith Spacie also excelled with a fine 32.59 for 110th for 2nd M60 (and 1st M70, of course).
