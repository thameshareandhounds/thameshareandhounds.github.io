<p class="summary">The ladies team of Rachel, Alison, Vanda and Kate crossed the line as first V35 team with Rachel taking the prize for fastest veteran leg and Alison not far behind.  As a non Surrey team they did not go home with a medal but a good time was had by all. In the mens event, the B team were 3rd and the A team 5th.</p>



            <div class="body">
            Second-claimers Corin Hughes and Darren Talbot made welcome appearances for the club in the B team whilst Andy Weir and David Symons were the pick of the A team whilst it was good to see Al Gibbons running after recent injury problems. 16-year old Westminster School pupil Tom Samuel also showed good early season form with 16.39 for the 5k (approx) loop.
