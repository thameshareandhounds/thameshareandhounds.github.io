title: "Second Sunday run + brunch a big success"

<p class="summary">It was terrific to see 20 people turn up for the Sunday run, most of whom then enjoyed a tasty brunch in the clubhouse. A big thank you to Kate who masterminded the whole operation. The next Second Sunday brunch will be on Sunday 9 October. All members welcome.</p>
