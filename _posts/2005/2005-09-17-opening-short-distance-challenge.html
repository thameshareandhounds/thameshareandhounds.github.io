title: "Opening Short Distance Challenge"
---

<p class="summary">Twenty-eight Thames men and women contested the Short Distance Handicap in some welcome late Summer sun.  First over the line was Matt Jones in 26.55, kept on course this year by the addition of some flags, closely pursued by Andy Weir and the Captain.  Alison Carpenter was first lady home and oh so close to winning her first handicap but was pipped to the post by fast improving James Ward. Thanks to the timekeepers and course markers and, as ever, to the Carver for a fine post race tea. </p>
