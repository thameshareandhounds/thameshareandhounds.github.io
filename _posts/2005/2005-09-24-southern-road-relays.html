<p class="summary">The M40 team finished off 18th out of 49 teams with super-vet Larry Matthew scything his way past 19 teams. The M60 were 7th with a star performance from Robin Dickson catching 7 teams on leg three. The Senior Mens team qualified for the National 6 stage with a workman-like team performance bringing Thames back in 14th out of 69 teams. With some of our star runners on (half) marathon duty it was left to John Macfarlane to lead the way with an encouraging 18:12 on leg one. Ian Harkness also dipped under 19 minutes. The engine room of Simon Baines, Nic Gould and Andy Howse then set the Captain up for the final leg.</p>
