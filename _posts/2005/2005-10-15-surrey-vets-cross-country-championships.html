<p class="summary">It was medals all round for the Thames ladies on a glorious day in Richmond Park. Rachel Disley was in stunning form to become surely the first Surrey Athletics President to win a county title in their year of office.  Rachel led from gun to tape winning the race and the v40 gold. Anna Garnier and Alison Carpenter had another close race with Anna producing a fine sprint for 7th place (v50 gold) ahead of Alison in 8th place (v45 silver). Kate Symons completed the TH&H runners showing a welcome return to form in 15th place (v35 bronze).</p>
