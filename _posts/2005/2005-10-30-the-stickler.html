<p class="summary">Andy Howse ended up 2nd in Dorsets toughest multi-terrain race. The 10 mile circuit of three massive Dorset peaks (Oakford Beacon  Hod Hill and Hambledon Hill with a total ascent of 1500 feet) is not for the faint hearted and provides a test for the finest athletes on the south coast. Despite a lung-bursting effort of 67.13 Andy was pipped by a local triathlete and is trying to live down the shame.</p>
