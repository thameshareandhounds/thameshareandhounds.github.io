<p class="summary">Despite two in the first three Thames were swept aside by a resurgent Herne Hill squad who thoroughly deserved their victory. John Macfarlane yet again led the way with an excellent second place with Phill Sly cruising round in third. </p>



            <div class="body">
            Ian Harkness (11) and the Captain (16) provided some middle order presence with Nick Altmann braving injury to record a superb 21st with David Symons a gutsy 26th. Darren Talbot and then a late flurry of saltires in the late 30s/early 40s closed the Thames team. HHH won the match with 182 pts to THH 228 pts which now puts the red & black squad some 74 pts in the clear. Two down and two to come. Time for the secret weapons to come out of hiding...
