<p class="summary">Four brave Thames ladies raced in the icy rain over the 4.5mile Dysart Cup course in Richmond Park.  Bethan had a good run up front with the Stragglers ladies and it was good to see Clare back in action, running well after a long injury break.  Michael Johnson was the sole Thames finisher in the mens race over the longer course.</p>
