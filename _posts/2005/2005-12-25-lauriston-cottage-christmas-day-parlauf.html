<p class="summary">Andy Robinson and Kate and David Symons managed to time their Christmas dinners around the traditional Christmas day parlauf run from Lauriston Cottage.  </p>

            Andy,paired with the quickest "A" string runner, won the race and led for most of the race with Dave not far behind. Kate found the whole thing rather more serious than anticipated - a speed session on Christmas Day (!)and may well stick to peeling the vegetables next year....
