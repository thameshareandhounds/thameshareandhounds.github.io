title: New Years Day 10k: Chris Daniels shows his class
---

<p class="summary">Either Chris Daniels had a quiet night in with some cocoa on New Years Eve or he is getting fit as he posted 34:18 for 6th place at the annual pipe opener in the Hyde Park 10k. Hugh Shields ran a creditable 35:34 for 14th place.</p>
