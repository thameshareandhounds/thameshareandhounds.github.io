<p class="summary">Bethan Hopewell flew around the challenging, muddy and hilly North Down course to place an excellent third. Kate and Anna inspired each other to finish higher up the field than in previous races and Karen, Maureen, Di and Isabelle completed the ladies team. It was a tough debut run for Isabelle - but she was still smiling - just - at the end. </p>
