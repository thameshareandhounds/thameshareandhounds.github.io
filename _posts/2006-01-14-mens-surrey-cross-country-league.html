title: Mens Surrey Cross Country League
---

<p class="summary">The mens team came up with a gutsy performance despite a  long list of absentees. At a cold and damp Guildford John McFarlane led Thames home in 3rd which by his own very high standards equates to a slightly below par run. The Captain broke into the top 10 for the first time in four years with David Symons storming round to 15th and his best ever placing. Darren Talbot was the fourth saltire in 18th whilst Chris Daniels showed the benefit of doing some hard gardening of late in 25th.  Herne Hill romped away to a big winning margin putting the league title beyond doubt. A feat that is no less than their superb packing has deserved all season.</p>
