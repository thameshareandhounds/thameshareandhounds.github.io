<p class="summary">A few (less) hardy Thames men and women braved the early chill wind in Bushy Park for this weekly event.  Kate and David Symons were rewarded with first and second place in the  ladies and mens race respectively and Hugh was not far behind Dave in fifth place.  The race is friendly, free and takes place at 9am every Saturday morning from the Diana Fountain car park.</p>
