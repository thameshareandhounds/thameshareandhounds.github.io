<p class="summary">A mixed day for Thames at this years Southerns. In the mens event the club were 6th which represented a good return given the current lack of availability of some crucial members of the club. Kay and Wendy tackled the constant climbs and twists of the parkland course with great gusto and finished a very respectable 158th and 228th respectively and Bethan Hopewell (running for first claim Bedford) had a good run for 37th. The captain improved upon his poor run last week at SLH with 31st with Ian Nick and John fairly close behind. Nick Malynn had the run of the day with a magnificent 78th before Andy Howse closed the team in 97th. Thames did however win the 12-to-score event by a sizeable margin.</p>
