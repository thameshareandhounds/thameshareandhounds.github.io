title: Long Mynd Valleys Fell Race
---

<p class="summary">A strong team of 6 made the trip to Church Stretton in Shropshire and competed in one of the more arduous fell races on the circuit on which many a northern fell runner has come a cropper. The Captain led the way home in 7th hotly pursued by Chris Daniels and Andy Howse in 12th and 13th. David Symons was next man home in 19th before the sprint of the century ensued between Ultra International Matt Lynas and GB rowing coach and new Thames recruit Nick Maloney. Matts dip at the finish was sufficient to see him win the battle for 39th. Bring on the Three Peaks was the cry!</p>
