<p class="summary">16 year old Tom Samuel gained the best position of the day with 92nd in the Under 17 Mens race which was his first time inside the top 100 in five national cross country events. Seven Thames men braved the chilly conditions at Parliament Hill. The Captains sprint was rewarded with 100th place whilst new member Julian Rendall was the star performer in 113th. Scotsman Nick Altmann was 153rd before Nic Gould rounded off an excellent break through season with Andy Howse close behind. Alex Gaskell rounded off the team with Frank Dudbridge a little further back.</p>



            <div class="body">
            In addition to the saltires on view many congratulations to Lucy Hassell who was 10th in the Ladies race and Nick Talbot who was a magnificent 8th and Sam Aldridge 77th.
