title: World Cross Country Championship - Fukuoka
---

<p class="summary">Thames lady Benita Johnson put what was by her high standards a disappointing Commonwealth Games 10km behind her to place an excellent fourth place in both the long course and the short course (held the following day) in the World Cross Country Champs in Japan.  Second claim Mara Yamauchi, who beat Benita to the bronze medal in at the Commonwealth Games, had a characteristically strong run to lead home the British women in 23rd place in the long course.  Well done ladies!  Mara will be in action again shortly in the London Marathon and we wish her well.</p>
