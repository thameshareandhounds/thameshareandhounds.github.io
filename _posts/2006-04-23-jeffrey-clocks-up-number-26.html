title: Jeffrey clocks up number 26
---

<p class="summary">Jeffrey Gordon "felt a little stiff" at the end of his 26th London Marathon, a cause for concern for our one remaining ever present.  It was a bright day for Thames as 21 members towed the line, with several bests and many other strong runs throughout the field.  Led home by Phill Sly who paced round the leading Brits, Ian Harkness ran a magnanimous race to finish tactically behind Mara Yamauchi who now claims second on the UK all time marathon rankings.  Johnny ran a strong 2.19 while Al, Chris, Frank and Julian all clocked best, sub 2.45 finishes.  Second claim Chris Finnill also racked up number 26 on the ever presents while Dave Moore ran a great race for 2.49.  Guy, Dan, Toby and Bill all had sound races, before Vikki clocked a further excellent best with Westminster school teacher Andy Johnson and Guy Dunscomb close behind.  Thames was closed by John Bryant who was pleased to close under the 5 hours.  Results below</p>
