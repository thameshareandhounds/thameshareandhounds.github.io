title: Chris Daniels tames the Three Peaks
---

<p class="summary">Thames were well represented at the 52nd Three Peaks fell race which takes in the summits of Pen-y-ghent  Whernside and Ingleborough over a 24 mile course with 4500 feet of ascent. Despite the inexperience of most of the team Thames claimed 3rd place in the team event which is thought to be the best ever result from a southern club. Star of the day was Chris Daniels who scythed his way through the field to finish a miraculous 13th. </p>



            <div class="body">
            David Symons and Andy Howse also ran superbly well-judged races finishing in 18th and 28th respectively. The Captain faded after an over ambitious start to 34th with UK 100km champion Matt Lynas hot on his heels in 39th. Nick Maloney ran a storming run to round off the THH representation in 118th.  Paul Newby provided the valuble role of course consultant having competed over the course 25 times. The team are already planning their assault for 2007!
