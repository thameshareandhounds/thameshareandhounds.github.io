<p class="summary">A posse of Thames runners were in action in the Greenbelt relay at the weekend.  Tim Woodthorpe, Tom Kingsnorth, and David Symons all had good wins for Stock Exchange and BPTT.net respectively while Richard Pitt and Peter Giles both ran well for the Millennium team.  BPTT.net ran out winners, after a hard fought battle over the weekend with Serpentine and Stock Exchange. </p>
