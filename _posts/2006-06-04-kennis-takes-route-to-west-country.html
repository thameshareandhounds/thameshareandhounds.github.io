title: Kennis takes route to West Country Glory
---

<p class="summary">Al Kennis is the unexpected champion of the Crewkerne 9.  Modestly he admits that had the leading nine runners not comprehensively diverged from the course at half way, led by Nick Altmann and including Larry Mathews, he may not have secured the win.  His knowledge of the Somerset course proved to be superior to that of the marshall in charge of a right turn, handing him a lead that he never relinquished.  Matt and John Bryant followed him home.</p>
