title: Welsh Castles Relay
---

<p class="summary">Thames fielded two teams at the Welsh Castles and performed admirably in sweltering conditions with the Open team finishing 21st and the Vets 45th. Those who ran on the Saturday took the brunt of the conditions which exceeded 29C in the afternoon. The club had two stage winners - new member Steve Paddock stormed into the lead with less than 150m of stage 9 to go and Matt Lynas tore the opposition apart on stage 19. NB: Full results now available.</p>



            <div class="body">
            In addition to these runs a host of members performed with distinction. Naomi Warner was a magnificent first lady and 6th overall on stage 6 and Vikki Filsell surged to the fastest female vet time on stage 12. David Moore also powered his way through the field to finish 6th on stage 15. New member Charlie Cooper also ran well for 12th on stage 18. Congratulations too to Frank Carpenter for answering the call and finishing leg 12. Many thanks to all those who ran or supported and help make for such an enjoyable weekend.
