title: Julia takes the spoils
---

<p class="summary">Julia Fea triumphed in the Midsummer handicap from Bruce Blackshaw and the President. Rumuors that Michael deliberately mislead the handicapper over the extent of his leg injury have been strenuously denied! Many thanks to Jeremy as well as Kay and Ian Higgins and Frank Carpenter at the finish. Thanks too to those members who very kindly flagged and de-flagged the course.  Next handicap - open to all - is Quentin Clough handicap, over the Harry Hawkes 8 course on 2nd July.</p>
