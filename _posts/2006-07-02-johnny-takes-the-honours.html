title: Johnny takes the honours
---

<p class="summary">John McFarlane took both individual victory and also the Quentin Clough handicap tankard at the Harry Hawkes 8.  With temperatures moving skywards, it was a day for the faster runners as they seemed less affected by the heat.  Thames won both the men and the ladies team prizes, led home by Naomi Warner who ran a fine 47 minutes for 1st lady and 9th place overall.  Race and handicap results below.</p>
