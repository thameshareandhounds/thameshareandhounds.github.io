title: Blisco Dash
---

<p class="summary">Inspired by their sucess the previous weekend the barechested holidaying TH&H men ventured into the fells once more. This time for the shorter - and steeper challenge of the Blisco Dash (5m/2000 feet). With three in the top five on the climb things looked promising until the steep descent when self preservation lead to eventual placings of Johnie and Dave in eighth and tenth and Nick a little way behind.</p>
