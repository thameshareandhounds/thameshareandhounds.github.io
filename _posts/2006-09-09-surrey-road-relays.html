title: Surrey Road Relays
---

<p class="summary">Thames fielded seven teams for the annual Surrey Road Relays in sun-drenched Wimbledon. Our W35 team gained a brilliant silver medal only a whisker off the top spot with magnificent running from Rachel,  Alison,  Vikki and Kate. Relative newcomers Rachel Haining, Karen Mitchel, Elizabeth Stavreski and David Crowther also ran very well in the heat whilst John McFarlane put in a magnificent display with three legs all sub 14:30 to gain an individual Surrey gold for fastest man over the course.</p>



            <div class="body">
            Tom Kingsnorth ran a storming opening leg for the B team announcing his return to form whilst Nick Malynn and David Symons ran strong legs for the Senior A team. David Moore was pipped by Larry by 1 second to the title of our fastest M40 whilst in the Vet 50 race Rick Turner ran a very strong 17.26. It was also great to see the club field two ladies teams in addition to our magnificent W35 team.
