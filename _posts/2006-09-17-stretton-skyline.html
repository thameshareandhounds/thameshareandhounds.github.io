title: Stretton Skyline
---

<p class="summary">Five Thamesmen braved the Stretton Skyline: a 19 mile fell race with 4500 feet of ascent and left with the team title for the second year in succession. The Captain finished 2nd with Nick Malynn storming through the field over the final 5 miles to finish an excellent 3rd. Star performer of the day however was Nick Maloney in 12th who was 12 minutes faster than in 2005. Jim Cox-Nicol found the going tough but battled round whilst Rhodri was seen smiling at the camera at every opportunity round the course!</p>
