title: Surrey Cross Country League - Men
---

<p class="summary">Despite the club rallying to field 15 runners in the opening Surrey League Thames were unable to get close to reigning champions Herne Hill who dominated the match at Brockwell Park. However with several new members making their debuts in the league and some star runners keeping their powder dry for the time being there is no reason why THH cannot fight back from their current 4th place.</p>



            <div class="body">
            John McFarlane ran well for 4th only 13 days after the Toronto marathon whilst the Captain sneaked inside the top 10 after a big charge on the second lap. Andy Weir indicated a welcome return to form and James Cordwell ran extremely well after running the Berlin marathon two weeks earlier. Close packing in the mid-order was rounded off by Pablo Lazo and Steve Paddock whilst it was great to see Tim Beer don the saltire rather than his golfing garb. Herne Hill now take a seemingly unasailable lead on to Coulsdon (11 Nov) but no doubt the saltires will be stronger later on in the season and will challenge Belgrave and Ranelagh.
