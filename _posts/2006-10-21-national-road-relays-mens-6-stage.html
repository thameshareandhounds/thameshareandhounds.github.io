title: National Road Relays: Mens 6 Stage
---

<p class="summary">Thames finished 43rd at Sutton Park with a make shift team that required two late changes in the 48 hours before the race. Given our lowly placing at the Southern 6 Stage (28th) this represented an improvement but it is still some way below the level that the club is capable of producing. It is hoped that we can be stronger for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>



            <div class="body">
            John McFarlane ran a strong first leg and the clubs fastest with 18:05 for the undulating 5.85 km route. The Captain was unable to prevent a flood of elite runners coming scything past but Andy Weir gained three places with a strong run on leg three. Nic Gould and Al Kennis shored up the second half before Steve Paddock brought the club home in 43rd.
