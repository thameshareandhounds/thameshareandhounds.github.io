title: Hutber Robs the Bank
---

<p class="summary">Second team captain Chris Hutber scored an unexpected victory over hosts Bank, K&P and some of the TH&H first team, with a well judged run over the Bank course.  Chris was followed home by new member and Westminster pupil Alex.  Rumours that flags had been removed leading the early leaders astray have yet to be substantiated..... The ladies captain led the ladies home with Maddalaine and Liz not far behind.</p>
