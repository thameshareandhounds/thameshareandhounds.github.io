<p class="summary">In the event formerly known as the KIMM (this year held in the Galloway Forest Park in southern Scotland) Chris Daniels and Simon Wurr finished 17th in the elite category out of 70 teams. Nick Maloney shot through the field in the B class on day two to finish 52nd out of 300 whilst Andy Robinson battled through injury to finish 65th in the medium score out of 260. All categories involve teams of two completing a long distance orienteering course in a mountainous area carrying full camping kit for an overnight stay. None of the above are planning returning to the area in the immediate future!</p>
