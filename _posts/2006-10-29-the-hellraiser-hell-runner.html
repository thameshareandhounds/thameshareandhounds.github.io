<p class="summary">Alex and Victoria Richmond had mixed fortunes over this interesting sounding 12 mile XC course which included steep hills and waist deep bogs.  Alex lost the lead in the ladies race in one of the aforementioned bogs but hung on for third, Victoria meanwhile picked up a sprained ankle for her efforts.</p>
