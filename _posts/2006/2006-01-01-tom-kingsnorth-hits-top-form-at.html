---

<p class="summary">Tom Kingsnorth brought in the New Year in style with a terrific victory in the Lauriston 7 in 36:58. A new recruit to Thames, Tom is now getting back to the form that saw him win medals at English Schools level. A host of THH members also dusted off their racing shoes after the New Year festivities with Tim Nightingale (15th) and Dan Pescod (17th) having the best relative performances.</p>
