<p class="summary">SLHs middle order strength was too much for the 23 saltires that towed the line at a sun drenched Farthing Down. Stuart Major and Jason Simpson destroyed the field and in the end their superior numbers won the day by 372 points to 466.</p>



            <div class="body">
            On the plus side Nick Altmann made an encouraging come back in 4th and Chris Daniels and Nick Malynn both ran strong races in 6th and 7th. Chris Wrighton also ran a gutsy race for 8th and showed how good a runner he is going to be. 

Kate and Wendy were the only TH&H ladies in action. Kate led the ladies field home but Wendy called it a day after one lap having already run the Box Hill fell race earlier that morning!

Star of the show though was Robin Dickson who despite recent illness organised the team and scores at the finish.
