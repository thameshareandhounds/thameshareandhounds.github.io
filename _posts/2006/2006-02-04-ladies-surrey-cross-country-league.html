<p class="summary">Well, at the beginning of the week it looked like we might be able to challenge the all conquering Ranelagh ladies for a win in the final fixture.  However, by Saturday morning injuries, old and new, and a badly placed rabbit hole put paid to such thoughts.  That said we put in a pretty good performance.  Julia Bleasdale excelled winning the race with apparent ease on her league debut and return from injury.  Kate, Alison and Anna packing in through the 20s and Vikki not far behind made up the remainder of the scoring team.  Di, Julia Fea and fast improving Isabel provided the essential back up and all had good runs.  We finished fourth overall. The TH&H ladies should be proud of their performances over the season.</p>
