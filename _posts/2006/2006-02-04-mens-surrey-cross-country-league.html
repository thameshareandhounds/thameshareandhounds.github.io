title: "Mens Surrey Cross Country League"

<p class="summary">The fourth second place in the Surrey League demonstrates that we have been second best all season to our friends and rivals at Herne Hill. Despite losing our grip on the league after three straight wins it was great to see Ian Harkness and Nick Altmann bounce back after the Southerns. Tim Woodthorpe backed up his 23rd place in the Midlands with his best ever run in a saltire. It was also heartening to see Andy Weir gradually getting back to form and Alex Gaskell making the scoring ten after a period of illness. Many thanks to all members who have run for the club this season in what is always a highlight of the season.</p>
