title: "David Moore smashes the Thames Meander record"
---

<p class="summary">New THH recruit David Moore had an outstanding run in the demanding Thames Meander event, a 55 mile route from Reading to near Hampton Court. Despite suffering recently from an injured knee and at one point running on the ‘wrong’ side of the Thames, David defeated the 160-strong international field and set a new course record by 25 minutes with 7h 55. </p>
