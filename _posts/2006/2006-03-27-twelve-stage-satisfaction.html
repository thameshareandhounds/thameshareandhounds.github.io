title: "Twelve stage satisfaction"

<p class="summary">A mature performance at the twelve stage relays saw Thames finish in thirteenth spot and safely qualify for the National champs.  New signing Julian Rendall saw us off well before Rhodri consolidated our position.  Phill Sly characteristically lifted us fourteen spots with our fastest long stage before the vice captains weight of experience lifted us one additional spot.  David, Frank and Nick carried the progress up the table before we were seen safely home by Al, Ian, Hugh, Nic and Jerry.</p>
