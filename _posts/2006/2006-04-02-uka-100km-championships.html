<p class="summary">Matt Lynas used all his ultra racing experience to emerge with a magnificent victory in the UKA Championships. At 50km Matt lay in third 70 seconds off the lead and remained in second until four miles from the end when Lynas overtook Paul Harwood (who had pipped Matt at the Draycote 35). Matt maintained his pace to the finish to win in 7:17.40 some 92 seconds in front. As a result, Matt helped England to victory in the Anglo-Celtic Plate.</p>
