<p class="summary">Thames finished a magnificent 13th place thanks to a terrific display of running by all 12 members of the team. This represents the best ever placing the club has achieved. Ian Harkness set the tone for the day with a barnstorming leg one which Nic Gould maintained. Phill Sly scorched round the long leg in 26:24 - 10th fastest of the day - before Andy Weir consolidated on leg four. New member Julian Rendall ran another great leg holding 13th place before the engine room of Al Kennis  Nick Altmann  Frank Dudbridge and David Symons sparked into action to keep the club in the reckoning. Larry Mathews surged round a short leg before the Captain and Ed Catmur rounded off the afternoon. The final position of 13th matches our placing in the Southern 12 Stage! Well done to all concerned.
