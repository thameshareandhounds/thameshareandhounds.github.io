<p class="summary">A beautiful Spring evening in Richmond Park saw Belgrave take the mens title and Wimbledon Windmilers take the ladies title over the scenic course.  The event was particularly well supported this year, with 6 ladies making their TH&H debut, and there was also a fine attendance in the Albert for the post race drinks! Particular thanks should go to Nick and Wendy for organising such a fun event.  Full results now on the relays section.</p>
