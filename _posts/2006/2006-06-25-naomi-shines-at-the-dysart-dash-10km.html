---

<p class="summary">Naomi Warner put in another impressive performace at the Dysart Dash, finishing first lady for the second year running and ninth overall in 34.52 on the flat, but uneven course.  David Symons also ran well to take fourth place in the mens race.  It was great to see a number of new TH&H members in action, including Vanita Rasiah making her TH&H debut.</p>
