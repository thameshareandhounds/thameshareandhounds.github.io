<p class="summary">Phill Sly destroyed a good quality field over 5000 metres and was never headed after a first km of 2:50 and won in 14:33. John Macfarlane won the B string in very hot conditions at Norbiton. Nick Altmann also proved that alcohol can aid your performance with a highly encouraging 4.02 for 1500 whilst Simon Wurr finished 2nd in the 3km s/c in 9:21.</p>
