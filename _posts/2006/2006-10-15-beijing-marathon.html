<p class="summary">Matt Jones flew the saltire in the hotly contested Beijing marathon. Despite the presence of armed guards every 100m of the route and the somewhat erratic nature of the traffic control (not to mention a cold) Matt Ran 2h 41:35. Matt will be be back in the UK in the New Year and we hope to see him at some of our fixtures during this period.</p>
