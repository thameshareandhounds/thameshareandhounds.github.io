title: "Thames defeated by Oxford"
---

<p class="summary">Thames and Oxford University fought out a competitive contest despite both teams losing personel to the relays at Sutton Park.  Oxford prevailed 102-151 in the 7.5 mile race, and provided the winner in Martin Bishop.  Dave Symons delivered a superbly judged effort to come though the field for second.  Winner of the varsity match last year, Courtney Birch, showed that she will be hard to beat again by winning the ladies race in a very impressive time.</p>
