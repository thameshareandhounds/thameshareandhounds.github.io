title: "Surrey Cross Country League - Ladies"
---

<p class="summary">TH&H ladies put out a team of 13 runners for the second fixture of the season. Naomi Warner led for the first lap before going off course on the second but proved her strength of character to make her way back through the field and finish in the leading group.  Alex Richmond and Bethan Hopewell also placed high up the field with the ever improving Rachel Haining and Vicki Webb making up the first team.  Our second team of Alison, Maddalaine, Vikki, Elizabeth and Karen ran really well to secure first B team home and special mention should go to new members Maree and Jane for completing their first cross country race and to Chris for making a welcome return to racing this year.Overall  we placed equal second team tied with Stragglers behind Belgrave to take us to third place in the league with two more fixtures in the New Year. </p>
