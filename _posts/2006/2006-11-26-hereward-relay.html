<p class="summary">Thames were just pipped at the post and finished second team in a race that saw three TH&H teams run the 38 mile / 4 person off road relay event between Peterborough and Ely Cathedrals
</p>



            <div class="body">
            Nick Maloney set the mens team off with an encouraging 15th out of the 131 competing teams before David Symons scythed through the field with an inspirational second leg to bring the club up to 3rd. The captain saw off all the opposition on leg three to hit the front and anchor man Frank Dudbridge ran his heart out but was passed in the final few miles and had to settle for second place.  Kate Symons led off for the ladies finishing 2nd lady  handing over to Julia Kendall, who was making a welcome reappearance in TH&H colours, Liz and Vikki braved the worst of the mud on legs three and four for a good team result. Henk Altmann and Michael Johnson both ran strong legs in a veterans team. Anna and Michael did a fantastic job organising the TH&H runners and providing a most enjoyable pre race team supper.
