<p class="summary">Thames were well represented at the sharp end in this popular multi-terrain race held on an MoD tank-testing site near Aldershot. David Symons showed a clean pair of heels to the field but was closely followed by Tom Kingsnorth and 17-year old Tom Samuel to bring home a Thames 1-2-3.</p>



            <div class="body">
            David Moore ran strongly for 17th whilst young members Rameez Khan and Alex Scott also ran impressively to break into the top 50. Vikki Filsell steamed through the field whilst Liz Stavreski showed how rapidly she is improving at present.
