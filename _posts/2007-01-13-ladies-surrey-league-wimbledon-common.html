title: Ladies Surrey League, Wimbledon Common

<p class="summary">Catherine Bryson of Belgrave was first home, in a field of over 250 ladies, with a strong finish over the tough TH&H course.
Alex Richmond and Bethan Hopewell seemed to enjoy the mud and finished in their highest places to date in the league with Vicki Webb, Anna Garnier and Vikki Filsell  making up the Thames scoring team. Many thanks to the army of pioneers and timekeepers that ensured that the day was a great success. </p>
