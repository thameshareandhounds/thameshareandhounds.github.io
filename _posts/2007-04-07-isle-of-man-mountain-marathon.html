title: Isle of Man Mountain Marathon
---

<p class="summary">David Symons placed eleventh over the tough Isle of Man  31 mile mountain marathon, finishing in an impressive 5 hours 14. The race was run in sublime conditions, over some beautiful hills and coastal paths.  A challenge for Thames men (and women) for future Easter weekends perhaps?</p>
