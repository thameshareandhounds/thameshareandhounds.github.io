<p class="summary">Loyalties were spilt this morning with Thames men and women in action at both Wimbledon Common and Bushy Park.  Lucy Hasell made a welcome return from injury to win the ladies race at Bushy Park and David Symons and Hugh Shields placed third at Bushy Park and Wimbledon Common. Great to see Lucy, Maddalaine, Hugh and Steve Pollard making their debut WCTT/BPTT runs along with the regular Saturday morning runners.</p>
