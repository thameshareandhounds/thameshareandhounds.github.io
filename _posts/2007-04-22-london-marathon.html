title: London Marathon
---

<p class="summary">While the soaring temperatures put pay to some target times, Thames members still recorded some superb efforts in this year's marathon.  Early indications suggest that our men may have won the UK team title.

            <div class="body">
            While many around him fell by the wayside, John McFarlane produced another tough display to achieve an excellent 15th place.  Andy Weir won the <a href='http://www.belgraveharriers.com/skippers_corner/skippers_corner_40.htm'>race-long duel</a> with Will Cockerell as next man in, while Al Hart passed Julian Rendall in the dying stages to make up the 3 man team.<p>
Mara produced another sensational run for 6th, while Benita found the going hard after bravely following the blistering early pace but still soldiered on to the finish.<p>
There were plenty of other fine performances, notably from Jeffrey Gordon as he maintained his ever-present record.
