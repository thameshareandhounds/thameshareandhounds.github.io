<p class="summary">The recent good weather has seen the times at Wimbledon Common getting quicker, and of the 8 Thames runners 5 recorded course pbs including a huge 38 second improvement from Maddalaine.  Richard Pitt was the only Thames runner at Bushy Park, but ran well in his first outing over the course.</p>
