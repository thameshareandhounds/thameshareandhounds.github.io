<p class="summary">Thames fielded two teams at Sutton Park with our M40 team taking pride of place in 5th place and the M50 squad ending up in a highly respectable 20th. The undoubted star of the day was Ben Reynolds who flew back from the US to compete and took the first leg by storm recording a sensational 14:47 for the 3 mile course which ended up as the days fastest time.</p>



            <div class="body">
            In the M50 event Rick Turner put in a cracking run on the first leg to clock our fastest M50 time of 17.31 followed by almost as fleet efforts from Richard Pitt and Mike Farmery who put up the same time of 17.41.  Support by the only slightly less fleet Whitlock  Bostelmann and Davies brought us home in a respectable 20th place.  The M40 race was even better as Ben Reynolds justified his flight from California by leading the first lap from gun to tape coming home well clear of the field and the fastest time of the day by 10 seconds. We didnt quite have seven Ben clones to follow but stalwart runs from all kept us in the top 10 and up to 5th at the end.  A great result which puts us in striking distance of the medals next year. Particular thanks to some Sutton Park vets debutants: David Moore  Matt Lynas  and Frank Dudbridge and to star reserve Ian Higgins.
