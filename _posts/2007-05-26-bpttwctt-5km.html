<p class="summary">The 8.30am start did not deter Ian Higgins, Al Gibbons, Colin Price and David Jenkins from their regular Saturday 5km run.  Over in Bushy Park James McMullen and Will Cockerell placed third and fourth with Steve Pollard, Tim Nightingale and Jim Stephenson also having good runs.  Look out for the new Banstead Woods 5km, part of the same race series, starting late June.</p>
