<p class="summary">Victory in the handicap went to a resurgent and surprisingly lightweight Andy Robinson, from Simon Molden and Dan Pescod, who also showed very good form. Victory in the Short Distance Challenge went to Nick Altmann, back from altitude training (and stag weekend) in a fine 27:25.</p>
