<p class="summary">The heat of Chicago wasn't really suitable for mere existence, let alone running 26.2 miles, so many congratulations to Benita Johnson, Andy Weir and Ben Reynolds for brave and impressive runs. Benita finished 5th lady in 2:38:30, while Andy and Ben finished 2nd and 3rd vets in 2:33:53 and 2:37:58 respectively.
