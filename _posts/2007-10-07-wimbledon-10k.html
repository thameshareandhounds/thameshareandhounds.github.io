<p class="summary">Thames were out in force at the impeccably organised Wimbledon 10. 2nd claim star Huw Lobb won in 51:58, with the ubiquitous Mr Mcfarlane again 3rd in 53:11. It was also good to see Lucy Hasell back in competitive action, finishing an impressive 11th overall and 1st lady in 59:02</p>
