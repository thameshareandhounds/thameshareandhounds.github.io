title: Men's Surrey League

<p class="summary">On Wimbledon Common the men enjoyed a surprising and very welcome victory in the first match of the season. A massive team effort saw the team close with 203 pts, followed by Herne Hill with 220 and Belgrave with 263pts.

            We were helped in no small measure by marathon superstar Huw Lobb marking his debut in a saltire with a fine victory, closely followed by his sidekick, the ever reliable Johnny Mcfarlane. James Mcmullan continued his fine form with 11th place in his Surrey League debut, followed by Darren Talbot in 12th, and very impressive performances from Dave Symons and debutant Neil Chisholm also making the top 20.

No less impressive was the redoubtable Andy Weir, who brushed aside the handicap of having run 26 miles in the Chicago heat just 6 days before to finish 27th, and our team was closed with excellent performances from Andy Howse, Toby Pearson and the new svelte Andy Robinson. It was a magnificent team effort, many thanks to all 17 who turned out.
