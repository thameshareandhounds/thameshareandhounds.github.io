title: Cabbage Patch 10
---

<p class="summary">Some of us were incapable of contemplating a 10 mile race after the rigours of the previous afternoon's Surrey League and a tough evening in the Crooked Billet watching England trounce the French over a few beers. However, some of us are made of much sterner stuff. The indestructible John Mcfarlane ran a superb 51:04 to finish 3rd, and Dave Symons was no less impressive in finishing 12th in 55:43. Impressive performances were also recorded by Vets David Moore and Hugh Shields in 31st and 35th respectively, and Liz Stavreski ran a PB in 64:28.
