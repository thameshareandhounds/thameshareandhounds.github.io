<p class="summary">Toby Pearson continued his good form by winning the Wimbledon Time Trial in 16:38. The ever present Ian Higgins was relegated to 3rd place, but set yet another course PB of 17:07, another awesome performance. Also out in force were Clare Sylvester (21:55), Dina Lockwood (23:07 â€“ A PB) and Colin Price (26:40).</p>
