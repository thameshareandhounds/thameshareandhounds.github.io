title: Match vs Bank of England

<p class="summary">Eight men and six ladies formed the Thames squad for the annual scone - eating competition against the Bank of England.

            A fine selection of sandwiches led the way:  salad is rarity in cross county circles, let alone the rocket and roasted vegetables on display here.  These were followed by ample cream scones and delicious cakes. A score of ten was only missed because the tea was not served in pots.  Verdict: 9/10 on the DWT Scale.
<p>
As customary, the main event of the day was preceded by a race over 4.9 miles in Richmond Park.  The course as well marked this year, a fact that was sad for two reasons.  Firstly, even the quick but directionally challenged runners managed to complete the course, meaning there was new winner this year; secondly the bank team was diminished by a number of pioneers.
<p>
The race was won by Simon Molden in 27.09 followed ten seconds later by Ed Catmur.  Chris Hutber was 5th, with Tim Nightingale, the Kate Symons, Vikki Filsell and Keith Spacie filling places 7 to 10.  Al Gibbons gallanty allowed himself to be out-sprinted to the line by Rachel Haining.  Al Irvine, Jeff Armitage and Maureen Poole also managed to finish before the third bank runner.   Maddalaine Ansell was found limping in the woods by the President, but recovered sufficiently to help demolish the tea shortly afterwards.
<p>
Thames won the three to score against  Poly and the Bank, and the six to score against Poly.
