title: Mob Match vs Cambridge University
---

<p class="summary">Cambridge brought along a high quality team. Perhaps unsurprisingly, their ladies opted for the shorter 4 mile course, the race was won by Laura Spence in 24:23. For Thames, Alison Carpenter, perhaps buoyed by her son's sterling efforts as starter, finished 7th in 27:30.

Over the longer 7.5 mile distance, Cambridge easily won the 6 to score match with 27 points to 63. Paolo Natali won the race in 38:09, closely followed by James Kelly in 38:19. Although we couldnâ€™t match the students, the Thames team was considerably boosted by the unexpected presence of Ben Reynolds, who jetted in from the States especially for the race, although he may have had some other somewhat trivial business to attend to. Ben finished 4th in the sensational time of 39:33. It is many a year, if ever, since a Vet has run so quickly round the Thames course.
