<p class="summary">The ladies overcame the dubious pleasure of running around a pancake flat aeroplane park near Heathrow to record a superb team win. </p>



            <div class="body">
            They were led home by debutant Alice Braham, who won the Combined and Division 1 race, closely followed by Lucy Hasell. Bethan Hopewell ran superbly to finish 7th, and victory was assured by Liz Stavreski (25th) and Alison Carpenter (37th).

Not content with that, superb packing from Vicki Webb (39th), the Captain (42nd), Vikki Filsell (43rd), Clare Sylvester (52nd) and Rachel Haining (53rd) ensured that Thames also had the 1st B team. The win catapulted Thames up to 3rd place in the overall standings in Division One behind Ranelagh and Herne Hill. The first two will take some catching, but hopefully we can hold on to 3rd place at the very least.
