title: Men's Surrey League

<p class="summary">Men ran out convincing winners in their fixture, which was held at home on Wimbledon Common. </p>



            <div class="body">
            Huw Lobb maintained his 100% record in a saltire with another fine victory, closely followed by the ever reliable John McFarlane in 4th. They were followed by Phill Sly in 7th, making a very welcome if rare outing on the country, and cutting it typically fine, and Darren Talbot, continuing his good form from the first fixture in 9th.
<p>
Neil Chisholm also produced another fine run to finish 14th, followed by James Cordwell, making a welcome return to Surrey League action in 17th. The coup de grace was swiftly administered by old hands Nick Altmann (20th), Dave Symons (21st), Simon Wurr (29th) and Ian Harkness in 32nd. A superb team performance, and honourable mentions also go to Mark Gilbertson (37th), Chris Daniels (38th) and Alex Gaskell (43rd), who on another less auspicious day might well have scored.
<p>
The Thames total of 154 points made us convincing winners, and we now have a useful cushion of 90 points over Herne Hill and 161 over Belgrave. There is no room for complacency, but a similar performance at the next fixture in Reigate on January 12th will almost certainly be enough to bring the title back.
