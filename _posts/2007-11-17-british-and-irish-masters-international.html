<p class="summary">Ben Reynolds made the long trip from the States to Stormont, Northern Ireland to run for England.  He was unfortunate to sustain a thigh muscle injury with a mile and a half to go, but still placed 9th in 28:20 in a very tight race, in which Herne Hill Harrier Iain Lockett placed 2nd in 28:00. Ben also helped England to team gold,</p>
