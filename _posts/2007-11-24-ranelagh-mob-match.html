title: Ranelagh Mob Match
---

<p class="summary">Thames emerged glorious victors over Ranelagh at our home course by the healthy margin of 1057 to 1428 (35 to score). The saltires were led home by Tom Kingsnorth, emulating his recent good form on the road with an impressive 39:36. Phil Killingley of Ranelagh ran well to finish 2nd, particularly as he was followed by no less than 11 runners from Thames. The contest was a bit more even after that, but our neighbours and our friends were safely dispatched for another year.

Tom also gained the added bonus of winning the Long Distance Challenge. Congratulations also to Liz Stavreski for another fine run in winning the Ladies version in a time of 49:26.</p>
