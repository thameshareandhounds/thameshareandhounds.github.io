title: The Grim
---

<p class="summary">Simon Wurr scored a notable victory from in the gruelling Grim challenge, an 8 mile multi-terrain race. Simon’s protégés were also in force, Tom Samuel finishing a fine 2nd, with Alex Scott 22nd and Rameez Khan 45th in a very large field. Good to see Guy Dunscombe back in action, who finished 13th in the same race held on the Saturday.</p>
