title: "Mens Surrey League, Wimbledon Common"
---

<p class="summary">John Mcfarlane swept all his rivals aside with a powerful piece of running on the Common in the third Surrey League of the season that saw Thames cement their second place in the league. </p>



            <div class="body">
            John has been competing for Thames in the surrey league for nearly 10 years and no-one in this period has been more consistent for the club at the sharp end. Darren Talbot continued his fine run in 4th with Ian Harkness 6th and Andy Weir 11th. David Symons showed extremely encouraging form with Nic Gould turning in his best ever Surrey League placing. It was also highly encouraging to see Matt Jones back racing for Thames whilst on an extended break from his posting in China.
