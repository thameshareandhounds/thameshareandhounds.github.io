<p class="summary">Congratulations to Al Gibbons who ran his fastest time over the 7.5 mile course for two years to take the prized tankard, with Nick Malynn hot on his heels.   Nick was also second fastest over the course, behind Nick Altmann who demonstrated the mixed benfits of altitute training and tequila consumption.</p>
