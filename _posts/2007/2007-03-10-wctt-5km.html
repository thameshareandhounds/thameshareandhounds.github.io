<p class="summary">Keith, Anna and Clare joined WCTT regulars Ian, Colin, David and Simon to dodge the puddles and the dogs in this weekly 5km run over Wimbledon Common with the Thames men and women recording some of the highest age graded times for the event. If you havent tried this event yet give it a go!
