<p class="summary">Thames finished a magnificent 5th at a windswept Milton Keynes with a great all round team performance that saw the club gain crucial places throughout the afternoon.</p>



            <div class="body">
            Julian Rendall got the ball rolling with 20th on the fast opening leg before Steve Paddock, Andy Weir and new recruit Andrew Macnamara (our fastest short leg runner of the day with 17:41) moved Thames up to 11th. The engine room of the team in the shape of David Symons, 17 year old Tom Samuel, Ian Harkness and Nick Malynn (returning from injury) consolidated our position in 10th at the end of leg 8. Nick Altmann showed his class by bringing Thames into the top ten on leg 9 before Larry Mathews and the Captain gained one place apiece. On the final leg Chris Daniels timed his run to perfection and stormed past two more clubs to bring us home in 5th.
