<p class="summary">Thames finished 23rd at Sutton Park in the National 12 Stage. Ian Harkness ran our fastest long leg of the day and from there on Thames fluctuated in the 20s with Andy Weir and Julian Rendall gaining ground with strong performances in the middle part of the race. It was great to see members such as Tom Samuel, Toby Pearson and Andrew McNamara compete at this level for the first time and this hopefully bodes well for next season under the soon-to-be-new captain Larry Mathews.</p>
