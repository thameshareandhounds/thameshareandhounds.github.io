<p class="summary">A select group of Thames men contested the Surrey Road Relay Championships at Wimbledon Park.</p>



            <div class="body">
            The Senior Mens Team finished a very creditable 8th, with fine runs from a very ill Tom Kingsnorth and Chris Daniels, who brought his two sons along, allowing Paul Whitlock to demonstrate his babysitting skills. Pride of place went to Nick Malynn, who ran two excellent legs of 15:13 and 15:31.
<p>
However, it could have been so much better, as Nick managed to miss his handover with the incoming runner, not once, but twice!!  Oscar Wilde made a pertinent remark in a slightly different context (he wasn’t overly keen on running) that I can’t quite recall, but it was, you can be assured, sheer entertainment.
<p>
The V40 team also managed very creditable bronze medals in the county championships.  After the captain rose from his death bed to record what he described as "absolutely risible jog", the team were rescued by fine runs from David Moore (16:25) and Hugh Shields (16:35) and a typically robust performance from Al Irvine.
<p>
The V50 team also finished a fine 3rd, thanks to a great run from Mike Farmery (17:07), two excellent runs from Rick Turner (17:07 & 17:57), and able support from the aforementioned Mr Whitlock. Unfortunately, the captain being of unimpeachable moral character, he disclosed the duplication to the organisers, with the result that the team were denied bronze medals.
