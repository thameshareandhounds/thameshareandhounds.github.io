<p class="summary">Second claimer Andy Arbour continued where he left off in the Welsh Castles with a strong run for 3rd place in 27:35, whilst pride of place amongst the saltires went to the youth wing in the shape of Tom Samuel, who had a fine run finishing 4th in 27:52, less than half a minute behind the winner. </p>

            He was ably backed amongst others by Simon Molden in 8th, making a welcome return to racing, and Dan Pescod in 10th, showing much improved form.

The upshot of the collective effort was that Thames defeated Kingston and Poly by 132 to 185 in the 10 to score match, and also won the 6 to score with 60 points, from Hercules Wimbledon (75 pts) and Kingston and Poly (79 pts).  Not a victory that is likely to shake the athletics world to its foundations, but a winâ€™s a win, so many thanks to everyone who braved a pleasant afternoon to run.
