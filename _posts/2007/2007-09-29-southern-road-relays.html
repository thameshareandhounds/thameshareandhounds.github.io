<p class="summary">At Aldershot the Senior Men qualified reasonably comfortably for the National 6 Stage in 19th place. </p>



            <div class="body">
            As is customary, John Mcfarlane led the way with a fine 18:38 on the 1st leg, and he was backed up with fine runs from Julian Rendall, James McMullan and Andy Weir. At that stage we were close to the top 10, when our numerous absentees due to injury, stag dos etc, made it a slightly nervous conclusion, but a robust performance from Tim Beer and a typically dependable run from Matt Lynas saw us home safely.

A below strength V40 team finished 18th, but were superbly led by Andy Howse, who ran a fine 20:38 on the first leg. The captain then rather spoiled it, before we unleashed our secret weapon in the shape of Robin Dickson, before Andy Thomas led us home with an encouraging return to form. Thanks also to Mike Farmery for casting aside illness to offer his services. A full strength and fully fit V40 team will be in real contention come the National Road Relays next May, so hopefully greater things lie ahead.
