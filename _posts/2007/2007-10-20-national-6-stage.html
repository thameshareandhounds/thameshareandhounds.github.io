<p class="summary">A select group of Thamesmen competed in the National 6 Stage at Sutton Coldfield.</p>



            <div class="body">
            Andy Weir gave the team a solid start (18:44), then a late withdrawal brought the young at heart Robin Dixon to the start line. Enormous thanks to Robin for turning out at short notice and ensuring that we completed the race. Robin handed over to James Mcmullan, who had to endure a somewhat lonesome start to his career in National relays from the back of the field. James had a fine run (18:57), as did Dave Symons (19:27), the Captain narrowly avoided the ignominy of being lapped by winners Belgrave before Matt Lynas brought us home in 71st place. Not quite up to the standard of previous years, but many thanks to all who turned out.
