<p class="summary">In Richmond Park Alison Carpenter placed an excellent 3rd W45 and 10th overall in the ladies race, the Ladies Captain also excelled as 3rd W35 (much too young to be a real vet), and 13th overall. Karen Jones placed 9th W45.
<p>
The men were largely represented by the more venerable element, Rick Turner had another fine run to finish 2nd M55 and 23rd overall. Dave Walsh was 14th M60, Peter Giles finished 3rd in the M60 category, and the legendary Keith Spacie was 1st M70.
