<p class="summary">Several hardy souls braved the rigours of the OMM in the Lowther Hills, which involved 2 days of running in the mountains, sleeping in tents, getting cold and wet, and like discomforts. </p>



            <div class="body">
            Many congratulations to Simon Wurr and Nick Maloney for finishing 13th in the B class, an awesome performance. Well done also to David and Miriam Rosen, who finished 117th in the B class, and to Chris Daniels, who was 27th in the short score event. The only slight downer was the failure of the dream team of Dave Symons and Nick Malynn to advance beyond day 1, due to Mr Malynn sustaining what was described as a "groin strain", which resulted in the brave duo roughing it on Saturday night in Carlisle.
