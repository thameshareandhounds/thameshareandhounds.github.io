<p class="summary">Andy Weir won in a very useful 16:29 for 5k, closely followed by Toby Pearson in 16:35, a course PB. No less The ever present Ian Higgins, set yet another course PB in 16:59 in finishing 4th. That amounts to an improvement of about 2 minutes over the space of a few months, which is extremely impressive. Also flying the saltire were Dina Lockwood (24:08) and Colin Price (25:07).</p>
