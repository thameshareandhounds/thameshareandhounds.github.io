<p class="summary">The IFFCCC were held in Richmond Park. Thames are traditionally dominant in this most cosmopolitan of events, and this year was no exception. Andy Weir continued recent good form with a victory, running for Fidelity Fat Cats. Close behind was Nick Altmann (Barclays Big Moggies), followed in 4th by Chris Daniels  (HBOS Large Pussies – not the first team he’s competed for in this one!), and Andy Howse in 5th (Fidelity Fat Cats). Mr Daniels led HBOS to a surprise victory, which was apparently greeted with typical modesty.</p>
