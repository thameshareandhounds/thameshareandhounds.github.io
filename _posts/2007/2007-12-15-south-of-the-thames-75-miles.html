title: "South of the Thames 7.5 miles"

<p class="summary">The longer format of the South of the Thames took place at Nork Park, Banstead. The new men of Thames were obviously out Xmas shopping, as male representation was restricted to the legendary stalwart that is Andy Weir, who had a fine run to finish 8th. Our ladies fared rather better, led home by Liz Stavreski in a fine 5th place, followed by Charlotte Saunders in 10th and the Captain in 14th.</p>
