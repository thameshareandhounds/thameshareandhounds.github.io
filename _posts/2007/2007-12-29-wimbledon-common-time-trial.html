<p class="summary">The race saw a rare if welcome outing in a saltire for Phil Tedd, who won in 17:13. You will be reassured to know that the ever present Ian Higgins was present, along with other Thamesmen, although unusually far down the field, hopefully just taking a rest from the other 51 races in the series so far!</p>
