title: Ladies Surrey League - Reigate
---

<p class="summary">Naomi was the star of the day over a good muddy course with her third place finish securing the "A" team third team place (behind SLH and just behind Ranelagh). It was great to see us just short of closing three teams including first "B" team.

            <div class="body">
            Naomi did us proud up front, finishing third making a very welcome return to cross country running, and likewise Dorchie getting back to racing. Then came the THH pack, Liz and Charlotte and the ladies captain to close the A team.  Alison, Vikki, Rachel, Anna and Lorna to complete a very strong B team, and Sarah (new to the delights of cross country) to copmplete the C team of Maureen, Jane and Di.

This leaves us in third spot in the league behind Ranealgh and Herne Hill.  A good turnout for the last fixture could see us move up to second, but we have a resurgent South London team hot on our heels.
