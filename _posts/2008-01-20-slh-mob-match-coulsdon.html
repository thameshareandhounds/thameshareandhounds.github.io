title: SLH Mob Match - Coulsdon
---

<p class="summary">In a slippery Happy Valley Thames dominated the front of the match against South London Harriers and Herne Hill.  Simon Wurr ran out winner on a course that he favours, just ahead of Dave Symonds who had an excellent run for second.  Tom Kingsnorth was running with them before falling foul of the underfoot conditions when taking a heavy tumble.  Liz Stavreski was the first lady home.<p>
Thames won the match between all three clubs, but were defeated when scoring 11-a-side against the hosts. For some photos of the day see: http://www.photobox.co.uk/album/7482456 </p>
