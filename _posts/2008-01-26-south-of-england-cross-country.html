<p class="summary">Despite relatively dry weather leading up to the race, the Heath still showed most of its teeth, and those who braved it were treated to a typically muddy experience. The Men were superbly led by James McMullan, who finished 46th in his first attempt at this race, a performance which bodes extremely well for the future. The remainder of the team, while unable to repeat the heroics of yesteryear, ran steadily in what are always difficult conditions. Andy Weir (66th), Nick Altmann (92nd), Chris Daniels (101st – very impressive, pity you couldn’t do the Tough Guy!), Andy Howse (111th) and Simon Wurr (114th) secured 9th team. Well done to all who turned out and ran.
