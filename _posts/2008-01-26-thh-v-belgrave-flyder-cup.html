title: THH v Belgrave Flyder Cup
---

<p class="summary">Our intrepid athletes couldn’t rest up after the Southerns, as the evening saw the inaugural “Flyder Cup” darts match between Thames and Belgrave at Belgrave Hall. A night of unforgettable drama saw fortunes swing to and fro, but ended with Belgrave snatching victory in the final leg. </p>

            It’s perhaps invidious to single out individuals, but Alun Johns and Nic Gould demonstrated rare ability, perhaps benefiting from their extended absences on the running front. James McMullan also showed that he can handle more than one sport, and Alison Carpenter celebrated Australia day with a handy command of the arrows. Many thanks to Will Cockerell and to Belgrave for their hospitality, revenge will be ours!...
