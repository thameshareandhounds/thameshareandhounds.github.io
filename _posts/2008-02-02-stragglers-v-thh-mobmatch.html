title: Stragglers v THH Mobmatch
---

<p class="summary">Many thanks to the Stragglers for inviting us to race over their new 5 mile riverside course. As billed, it was flat but pretty muddy in places. David Symons took an early lead, before being overhauled by Straggler Graham Brook and Liz Stavreski ran well for first lady.  A  mob, well more of a select crowd, of TH&H runners completed the course, with Stragglers easily winning the match, before returning for the traditional mob match tea.</p>
