<p class="summary">With no local fixture this weekend TH&H members were in action over the local 5km time trials. David Symons placed third at Bushy Park and Anna Garnier placed second lady at Wimbledon Common with a pb.  Lorna also showed huge improvement with a 57 second pb.  Interestingly, TH&H men and women filled three of the top four "age graded" performances, the table headed, of course, by Keith Spacie.</p>
