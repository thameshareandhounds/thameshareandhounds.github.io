<p class="summary">The going is getting rough under foot over at Wimbledon, making for slower times, but more fun!  Thames men and women put in solid performances led home by Ian Higgins in fifth and Alison Carpenter second lady.  Over at Bushy Park it was a little easier under foot, and was good to see Andy Howse returning to his old patch.</p>
