title: The Outlying Run
---

<p class="summary">Many thanks to Andy Howse for once more organising a wonderful running location and stunning weather for the Outlying run in Lyndhust.  Saturday saw Thames men and women running, cycling and walking the carefully selected routes of 6 to 16 miles before a fine dinner and, yes the guitars were out, but no ukulele this year...</p>
