<p class="summary">Lucy Hasell started her hen weekend with a sprightly run to place 2nd with 17:22 in a quality ladies field, with chief hen Dorchie Cockerell placing 6th in 18:34.  The Thames men, surely not invited to the party, were also in form, with John MacFarlane placing 2nd with 15.41 and Will Cockerell 3rd with 16:17.</p>
