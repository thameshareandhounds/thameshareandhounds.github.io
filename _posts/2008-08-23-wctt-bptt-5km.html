<p class="summary">The time trials at Wimbledon during August saw some good battles between Ian Higgins and Andy Robinson, with Ian (3rd in 18:39)just pipping Andy in on 16th August, a feat he repeated on 23rd August(4th in 18:08).  However, pride of place goes to Julia Bleasdale, with an awesome run on 16:53 at BPTT, finishing first lady, by a consdiderable margin,  and 8th overall.</p>
