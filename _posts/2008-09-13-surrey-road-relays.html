title: Surrey Road Relays

<p class="summary">Thames fielded a mens team that competed well, with great runs from Stuart, James and Chris in particular, but 
was ultimately a little too long on experience and short on raw pace finishing 5th in a race comfortably won by Belgrave. The ladies fielded a vets team, and placed fourth, warming up for the road relays at Aldershot later in the month.</p>
