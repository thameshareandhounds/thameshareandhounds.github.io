<p class="summary">John Macfarlane showed that his recent move to the West Country has not diminished his form, with a typically stong performance to place 7th in 68:46, with Tom Kingsnorth also running well in his debut half to place 38th in 74:48.  Pride of place however goes to Lucy McAlister (formerly Hasell) who finished second in the ladies race in a superb 74:35, and also to Antonia Burt coming back from injury to clock 91:03.</p>
