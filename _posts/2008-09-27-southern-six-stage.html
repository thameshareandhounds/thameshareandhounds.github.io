<p class="summary">A resurgent Phill Sly brought Thames senior men home in 14th spot at a stunning sunny Aldershot afternoon.  It was great to have Ben back on home shores to lead the team off strongly.  The middle order of Toby, Andy, Julian and Dave consolidated the position, before Phill brought us home.  Also in action the ever reliable V60 team of Robin, Peter, Michael and Hugh giving away a few years in their age group but still taking home well won bronze medals. Results below.</p>
