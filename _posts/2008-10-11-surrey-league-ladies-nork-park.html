title: Surrey League - Ladies Nork Park
---

<p class="summary">A slightly depleted team of THH ladies took to the starting line at new venue Nork Park for the start of the cross country season. Sonia ran well for fourth spot in a quick race with Liz, Vikki, Anna and new member Kate all running well to make up the scoring team. SLH were run away leaders on the day, and although the THH ladies wound up "mid table" there is still plenty left to race for in the next 3 fixtures.  Please put Lightwater - November 8th in your diaries now!</p>
