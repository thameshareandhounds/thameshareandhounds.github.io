title: Thames off to a winning Surrey League start (just)
---

<p class="summary">Thames nipped the victory in the opening race of the Surrey League campaign, but it was desperately close with The Hill only two points back.  Thames had a strong lead off with five in the top ten - including Phill Sly making a welcome return and Stuart making his innaugural Surrey League race in the Saltire.  But the hoops packed well, and when James closed the team it was all to play for.  Two points was about the winning margin for The Hill last year - looks like a close one this season as well.</p>
