---

<p class="summary">Liz Stavreski was the lone saltire in action at Lloyd Park, and she put in a good performance to place 9th lady.  The 7mile South of the Thames race takes place closer to home on Saturday 20 December,starting on the village side of Wimbledon Common - the perfect excuse to avoid Christmas shopping.  Please let Kate or Larry know if you wish to run, as runners must entered in advance.</p>
