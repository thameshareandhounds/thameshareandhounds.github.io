title: Thames v Ranelagh Mobmatch
---

<p class="summary">Notwithstanding that TH&H dominated the opposition at the sharp end, taking 13 of the first 14 places, our friends and rivals Ranelagh defeated us on a suitably cold and grey afternoon in Richmond Park. Once again, James McMullen led the way, continuing a fine winter season with victory (41:46), with impressive runs from Simon Wurr (42:11) and Stuart Major (43:47) in 2nd and 3rd respectively. In the early stages, the saltires kept on coming, but mob matches are about mobs, and unfortunately the weight of numbers put in the field by the opposition told. Ranelagh finished over 60 runners to 39 finishers from Thames, and our neighbours prevailed by 1,526 points to 1,637. Many thanks to those who ran or supported, and to Ranelagh for the post race supper.</p>
