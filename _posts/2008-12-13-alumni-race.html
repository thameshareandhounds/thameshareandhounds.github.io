<p class="summary">As you will no doubt recall, last Saturday was somewhat inclement, not to put it mildly, but the cruel winter weather did not deter the hardy competitors in the annual Alumni Race on Wimbledon Common, which as usual included many Thames members.

            The King Henry VIII Cup for the Open Event was won easily by Sedbergh with 24 points, having been  second to Winchester for the previous ten years, other than in 2003 when they won.  Sherborne  were 2nd (76), followed by  Winchester (89) and  Westminster (95).  The Old Brentwoods’ Trophy for the Vet 40 event was won by Winchester (25), followed by Westminster (44), Charterhouse (47) and Sedbergh (51)   The Chataway Cup for the Vet 50 event also went to Winchester (20), followed by Westminster (27) and Denstone (30).  This was the first year for the presentation of the Norman F. Berry Cup to the individual winner, donated by Sedbergh in the name of their illustrious exemplar, Norman.  The winner was James McMullan of Charterhouse in a time of 26’ 05”, V40 individual winner was David Symons (Monkton Coombe – 29’ 33”) and of the V50 – Richard Pitt (Charterhouse – 31’ 33”), all three with home advantage.   Well done to all who ran, and can I add my thanks to David Jenkins for his organisational efforts, to the Chief Pioneer and to everyone else involved in pioneering and officiating in such awful conditions and to the Carver for a fine tea.
