title: "Surrey County Championships - Lloyd Park"

<p class="summary">The men achieved silver medals at the Surrey County Championships, a great achievement bearing in mind the minimal size of the team.
<p>
Packing at the front was the order of the day, as James Mcmullan, John Mcfarlane and Neil Chisholm all had fine runs to finish 5th, 6th and 7th respectively. Andy Weir was his usual reliable self in 13th, with Al Kennis and Anthony Doolittle filling the vital 5th and 6th team slots in 51st and 66th respectively. Herne Hill were convincing winners, but their sterling efforts saw off the rest of the opposition. 
<p>
Many thanks in particular to Al for coming all the way from Leeds to ensure that we completed a scoring team.
<p>
The ladies also performed with much credit, finishing 5th team, led home by Liz Stavreski in 20th, ably supported by Alison Carpenter (35th), Vicki Filsell (38th) and Maureen Poole (53rd).
