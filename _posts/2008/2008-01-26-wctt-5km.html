<p class="summary">Ian Higgings has finally completed his  year long WCTT streak and appears to have favoured bed over running for at least one Saturday morning this year.  We have also noted the appearance of V70 Brian Leech sporting the saltire and setting a pb each week to date this year.  This week saw fine runs from Anna Garnier and Andy Robinson to finish first lady and second man.</p>
