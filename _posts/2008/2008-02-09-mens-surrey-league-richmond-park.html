title: "Men's Surrey League - Richmond Park"
---

<p class="summary">A fine performance from the TH&H men was not enough to hold off the charge of the men in black and red. It was a case of so near yet so far. A lead of 27 points over Herne Hill proved to be not quite enough, who won the final fixture and the League overall by a mere 6 points, or an average of 1 ½ points per race!

It has been a long time coming, but Nick Talbot’s first outing in a saltire proved to be a memorable one, finishing 2nd in a high quality field. Nick was closely followed in 5th by Neil Chisholm, who has improved in every race and completed a superb series of races in his debut season for Thames. The younger and more beautiful Talbot (?) also produced a fine run to finish 10th, with James McMullen producing another impressive run in his debut season in 15th.

There followed Thamesmen at very short intervals after that, with Toby Pearson finishing in a very impressive 20th, the ever reliable Dave Symons in 24th, and Simon Wurr, Tom Kingsnorth and James Cordwell grouped together in 27th, 28th and 29th respectively. The ever youthful Chris Daniels closed the team in 36th, but it was not quite enough. Thanks to all who ran and turned out to support. Particular congratulations go to Huw Lobb, for winning all 3 fixtures in which he competed, a feat unchallenged in the history of Thames.

            Thanks to everyone who turned out in all 4 fixtures and contributed to a magnificent team effort, in which 18 runners scored over the 4 races and many others also ran well. Particular congratulations go to Huw Lobb, for winning all 3 fixtures in which he competed, a feat unchallenged in the history of Thames. We were of course missing a number of top runners on Saturday, and if any number of little things had turned out differently, we could have regained the title, but we gave it our best shot, and lost narrowly to a very impressive team. Hopefully we will make it even harder for them next year.
