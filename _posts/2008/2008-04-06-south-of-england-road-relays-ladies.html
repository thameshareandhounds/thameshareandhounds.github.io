title: "South of England Road Relays (Ladies)"

<p class="summary">The Ladies team were unfortunately weakened by a number of late withdrawals due to injury, and did well to place 16th, in particular Naomi Warner, who again ran superbly to place 12th fastest of the day. She was ably backed up by Vikki Filsell, Rachel Haining, Enfys Jones, Anna Garnier and Maddalaine Ansell. Well done also to Kay Scarpello, Natalie Farr, Lorna Celiku and the Chief Pioneer for completing 2/3 of a B Team. </p>
