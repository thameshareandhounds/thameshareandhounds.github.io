<p class="summary">The Mens team again excelled to finish 6th, and were never outside the top ten. The long legs from Johnny Mcfarlane, Julian Rendell, Andy Weir, Toby Pearson, Simon Wurr and James McMullan were a model of consistency, with able back up from short legs Nick Malynn, Dave Symons, Andy Howse, Nick Altmann, Alex Gaskell and Matthew Lynas. Many thanks to all who ran and to whose who braved the chilly conditions to support.
