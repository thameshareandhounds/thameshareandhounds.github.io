<p class="summary">Last Wednesday saw the ever popular Parkland Relays in Richmond Park, which this year were blessed with a beautiful sunny evening and some excellent performances from Thames runners. </p>

            The TH&H Ladies race saw a convincing win by Thames, led by a superb first leg run from Lucy Hasell in 16:10, ably backed up by Dorchie Cockerell (17:45), making a welcome return to racing with husband and baby Sebastian in tow, and Rachel Disley (19:12). Not content with the fastest leg, Lucy also ran the 2nd fastest leg of the night in 16:49 for Belgrave B Team. The ladies 2nd team also ran impressively for 5th place courtesy of Vicky Filsell (19:40), Maureen Poole (22:40), and Rachelâ€™s daughter Poppy Disley (20:40). A fine generation spanning effort from the Thames ladies.

The TH&H Men made it a double victory from Thames on the night, winning convincingly from Belgrave, who looked like they might challenge at one stage, before deciding to throw a triple jumper into the mix. This time fastest leg of the night was shared by two Thames runners, James Mcmullan (14:47), and Simon Wurr,turning out for Westminster School. The remainder of the Thames team, namely Toby Pearson (15:05), Andy Weir (15:08) and Dave Symons (15:25) all had excellent runs. Andy also ran another fast leg to bring home the Thames Vets team of Al Gibbons, John Bryant, and Jeremy Denny.
