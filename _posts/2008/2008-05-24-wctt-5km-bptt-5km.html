<p class="summary">George Garnier must have been taking some training tips from his Mother Anna to set a new pb of 16.46 and take third place at Wimbledon. Hugh Arnold and John Bryant also made the most of the dry conditions for course pbs.  Over at sunny Bushy Park Julia Bleasdale showed she is finding form again with a "steady" 17.19 to place first lady with team mate Sonia O'Sullivan in second spot. David Symons placed third in the men's race in 16.46.</p>
