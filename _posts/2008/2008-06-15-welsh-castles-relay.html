<p class="summary">Another Welsh weekend of glorious sunshine.  Full results awaited, but we are able to report that the Thames men were crowned overall "King of the Mountains".  Individual stage wins included King of the Mountains wins for Andy Weir, John McFarlane and James McMullen and ladies stage wins for Liz Stavreski and Sonia O'Sullivan.  The Welsh weather was kind once more and a good weekend was had by all.</p>
