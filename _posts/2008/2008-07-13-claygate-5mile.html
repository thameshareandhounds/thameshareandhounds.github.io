<p class="summary">The TH&H vets put on a good show at the Claygate Five.  Keith and Anna paced each other over a muddy splashy course on a gorgeous sunny day at what is a very "English" event. Anna placed 2nd Super vet with Keith a couple of seconds behind and Maureen and Di close on their heels.</p>
