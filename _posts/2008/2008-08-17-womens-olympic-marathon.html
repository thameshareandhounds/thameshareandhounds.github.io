<p class="summary">There were two TH&H ladies in action at the Olympic Marathon this weekend. Second claim Mara Yamauchi ran an awesome race, easing past the Russian runner in the stadium to finish sixth in 2hr 27min 29sec and equal the best ever finish by a Briton in the women's Olympic marathon.  Benita Johnson, running for Australia, also ran well to place twenty first, overtaking 15 runners in the last 15km of the race.  Well done ladies!</p>
