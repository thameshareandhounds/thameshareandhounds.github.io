<p class="summary">The ladies performed well, with a  Senior team and a Vet40 team in action.  The senior team of Sonia, Vikki #1, Benita and Liz enjoyed a yo yo up and down the placings to finish a very creditable ninth place with Benita recording the third fastest lap of the day.  The veteran team of Anna, Maureen, Alison and Vikki #2 placed fifth team, just outside the medals in a close race with Anna recording the twelfth fastest lap time.  Special mention to Vikki who proved she is made of tough stock by runnning for both the senior and vets teams.</p>
