<p class="summary">Andy Weir clocked a strong 1.14 for fourth spot in his second race of the weekend, with Dave Symons fifth in 1.15.  Hugh Shields completed the Thames triumverate but all three finished behind the Kenyan and rabbit-headed winner (even though he only put it on for the finishing straight).  </p>
