<p class="summary">The TH&H vets were in fine form this weekend, Anna Garnier took gold in the v50 ladies with Alison Carpenter just behind in silver, Keith Spacie took gold in the v70 men and Peter Giles led Peter Blair-Fish and Dave Walsh to silver medals in the v60 team event just behind SLH. Peter Blair-Fish reports that he was very happy to collect his first county medal for 40 years (previous medal for 3rd team in Surrey junior X-C in early 1968).</p>
