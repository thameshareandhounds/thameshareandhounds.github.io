title: "Cabbage Patch 10"
---

<p class="summary">Always a race that attracts a quality field, this year was no exception, with Magdalene Mukunzi fresh from her second place at the Great North taking the ladies title, and no doubt somewhat bemused as to the traditional prize of a cabbage.  Naomi Warner continued her good record in this event to place fourth in 59.29 with Maureen Poole also running well in one of her favourite races.</p>
