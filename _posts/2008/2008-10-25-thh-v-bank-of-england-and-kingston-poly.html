title: "TH&H v Bank of England and Kingston Poly"
---

<p class="summary">For anyone not familiar with the annual Bank of England fixture, it consists of a fine tea preceded by 4 1/2 mile amble around Richmond Park. The promise of a slap-up tea ensured a turn-out of 14 TH&H runners only one less than at the home mob-match against Stragglers!  </p>

            Chris Hutber reports on the tea...

This year there were amply filled smoked salmon and cream-cheese and chicken with garlic mayonnaise sandwiches as well as the traditional Thames favourite â€“egg.   The extra-large scones with lashings of cream and jam left at least one Thames member (f) looking less than lady-like. John Bryant got lost on the course, but made it back for tea, and at just over 49 minutes, his race was still over more quickly than his tea-time anecdotes.
