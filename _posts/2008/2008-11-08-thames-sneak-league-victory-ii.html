title: "Thames sneak League victory II"
---

<p class="summary">James McMullen made his first scoring victory in the Surrey League.  Revelling in the soft going, James led home one of the strongest turnouts - just nipping victory from The Hill, but it continues to be tight.  Phil, Stewart and Huw all closed in top ten positions themselves, with Mark Tuckett making a strong debut for 11th spot.  Simon ran a characteristically robust 14th while Chris - fuelled by banking adrenalin - chased home Neil and Ben.  It was left to Nick to close the team in 33rd place, with four back up saltires of James, Toby, Andy and Dave closing immediately behind.  Results of all 22 saltires racing below.</p>
