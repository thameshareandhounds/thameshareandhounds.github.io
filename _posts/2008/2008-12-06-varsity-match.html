title: "Varsity Match"
---

<p class="summary">The first Saturday in December is of course Varsity Match weekend, and the teams from Oxford and Cambridge were greeted by fine weather but difficult conditions underfoot. Victory went to Oxford in both matches, in the Ladies race by 15 points to 24, and in the Mens race by 27 points to 53. There were impressive performances from both universities, but our particular congratulations go to Thames member Tom Samuel for his part in the convincing Oxford victory.  Many Thames members were also to the fore in the annual “Old Gits” race over the Ladies 4 mile course. The race was won by Oxford Old Git Andrew Hennessey,  the leading lady was ex Cambridge 2008 Olympic cycling silver medallist (and starter of the ladies race) Emma Pooley. The team event was won by Oxford in a not entirely rigorous score of 34 points to 44, even though three quarters of the genuine alumni in the race were from Cambridge! Thanks to Nic Gould for sorting out the results so promptly, to the Chief Pioneer and his troops, and to Simon Molden for preparing a superb race program, aided by his predecessor, Nick Altmann, aka “the tipster”, who again demonstrated his uncanny inability to predict the outcome of sporting events.
