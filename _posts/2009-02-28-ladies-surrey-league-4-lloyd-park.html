title: Ladies Surrey League #4, Lloyd Park
---

<p class="summary">A good performance today laid to rest any possibility of relegation to division two. Julia Bleasdale and Lucy Macallister placed first and second with impressive runs in a good quality field.  Envys, Anna and Liz completed the scoring team and Vikki and Dorchie added essential back up to the team.  With injuries, and babies, taking their toll this season final calculations showed that TH&H ladies finished a rather disappointing tenth team in the league series but a welcome second team in today's race.  We'll be back!</p>
