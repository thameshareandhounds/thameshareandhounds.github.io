<p class="summary">Competition hots up for the title of Thamesâ€™ toughest man! While the self-styled Wharf's Toughest Guy, Chris Daniels, was competing at a less than fearsome vets indoor 1500 metres, real men Johnny Mcfarlane and Toby Pearson were displaying their own tough credentials in the Grizzly, a 20 mile multi terrain race in Devon.  John won in 2:19:21 by over 6 minutes, with young pretender Toby Pearson an impressive 3rd in 2:27:30.</p>
