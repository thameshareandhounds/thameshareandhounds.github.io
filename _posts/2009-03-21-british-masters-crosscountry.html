title: British Masters Cross-Country Championships

<p class="summary">Ben Reynolds ran impressively to finish 8th in the V35-49 race and 2nd V45, Peter Giles also made the long trip to North Wales and finished 8th in the V60 race. It has been a fine cross-country season for the Vets team, with hopefully more to come in the National Road Relays in May.</p>
