title: Kienbaum 100km
---

<p class="summary">Not content with a mere 26 miles 385 yards, Matt Lynas ran a superb 7:10:38 for 100km at Kienbaum, near Berlin, placing 2nd overall and 1st M40. Mind bogglingly, this equals his PB for the distance. Matt was rewarded for his considerable endeavours with a table tennis set, but hopefully further international recognition will be a more fitting reward. </p>
