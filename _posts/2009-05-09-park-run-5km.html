<p class="summary">Julia Bleasdale set the pace at Bushy this morning winning the race outright in 16.41.  Over at Wimbledon Andy Robinson ran 17.00 for third place ahead of the men's captain in 17.41 and Ian Higgins in 18.12.  A little further back Colin Price narrowly beat Andrew Simon to the finish line.  Julia and Larry were obviously feeling keen on Saturday, as both later took part in the Outlying Run in Dorking.</p>
