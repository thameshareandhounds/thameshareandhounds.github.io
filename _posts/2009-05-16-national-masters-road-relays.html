<p class="summary"> The V50 team kicked things off with a creditable 19th place, led off by Rick Turner, who produced a storming 17:21. Chris Cheeseman (18:33) ran well, as did Mike Sanford (18:56), making his competitive debut in a saltire. Rhodri Davies followed with 19:22, a recently returned Richard Pitt (18:16), with Mike Farmery making an early return from injury to close the team in 19:31.  For the V40s, it was a case of so near and yet so far, finishing 5th in a race impressively won by our friends and rivals from Herne Hill â€“ many congratulations to them on a great victory. Chris Daniels led the way with a superb 15:33 for 8th place on leg one, followed by Andy Howse (16:31) and the captain (16:37). Matt Lynas, jetting in from Germany to aid the cause, produced a very impressive 16:05, and then Ben Reynolds produced his usual storming performance (15:03) on leg 5 to put us briefly in 4th place. Jerry Watson (17:12) ran well, with Dave Symons (16:03) and Andy Weir (15:19) producing excellent runs in splendid isolation, bringing us home just under a minute outside the medals.</p>
