<p class="summary">Self proclaimed tough guy Chris Daniels has been very busy of late. May 23rd saw the mighty Surrey Vets track championships at Ewell. After his foray onto the indoor track this winter, Mr Daniels evidently fancied his chances of a soft county title. However, he reckoned without the always speedy Thames man Andy Robinson, who unleashed a devastating kick to win in 4:20, with Chris 2nd in 4:23. However, Mr Daniels bounced back into action on May 26th with an untroubled win in the Vets AC 5 mile road race in Battersea Park, in a time of 27:44. He then proceeded to return to his “tough guy” roots by finishing 5th in the Salomon X Turbo race on May 31st, which as far as I can make out, seemed to be a 10 mile race through bogs, but which was no doubt marketed aggressively as an “extreme running experience”.
