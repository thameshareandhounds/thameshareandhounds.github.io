<p class="summary">Congratulations to Al and Kay Kennis on their wedding this weekend, an activity that seems to have inspired several Thames men into recent engagements...  Congratulations also to Dina Lockwood and family on the recent arrival of baby Ranulph, tipping the scales at nearly 10lbs... </p>
