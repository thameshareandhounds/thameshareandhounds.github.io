<p class="summary">Our V40 team of David Symons, Andy Weir, Andy Robinson and Ben Reynolds were the stars of the day, running fantastically to take silver medals behind Herne Hill Harriers in a close encounter.
The V60s ran well to take 8th position with the returning Hugh Arnold running our quickest leg.
In the Senior competition we put in a solid performance to qualify for the National event at Sutton Park. Particular thanks to Toby Pearson who ran a week after his marathon in Berlin.</p>
