title: "Mens and Ladies Surrey League Coulsdon"
---

<p class="summary">There were mixed fortunes for TH&H at a stunning but cold Coulsdon. The men had to settle for second spot behind a strong Herne Hill squad, but had some fine individual performances from Stuart Major and James McMullan who placed second and third.  The ladies struggled to put out a team, but it was good to see Rachel Disley leading the TH&H ladies home ahead of debutant Claire Day, Anna Garnier and new member Kate Foster.  Full results to follow.</p>
