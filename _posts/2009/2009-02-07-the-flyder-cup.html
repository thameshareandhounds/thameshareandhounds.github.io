            <div class="body">
            As with the inaugural event, this was a nail-biting affair with the result in doubt almost until the last dart.  Herne Hill Harriers joined the fray fresh from their triumph in one of the most bruising and violent Surrey League campaigns since the infamous Belgrave massacre of 2000.  Thames had put up a valiant struggle all winter and it soon became clear that it wasn’t just over the mud that these two clubs desired to wage all out war, but over the oche too.  
36 players descended upon the stage, with no fewer than 15 supplied by Thames, armed with a handful of reserves, wives, girlfriends, infants, and newborns – all designed to intimidate or distract the opposition.  The format was for each club to play 6 doubles matches against each other club, thus 18 points to fight over.  
Defending champions Belgrave came out of the blocks like startled Rottweilers and armed with their secret weapon Mark Humphrey, who had his opponents, spectators and referee cowering in trepidation, surged into a 2, 1, 1 lead.  Thereafter Belgrave struck something of a void for the next hour or two, as they gallantly offered the floor to Thames and Herne Hill to try and rip each other’s kidneys out, as they so desired.   
Herne Hill tore into a 5, 3, 2 lead but then Thames had a purple patch in the final three-quarters of an hour, and with the final two matches out on the course they led 7, 6, 3.  However, both of those matches involved Herne Hill, and only one Thames.  Belgrave were wounded furry animals by now and the wise heads were already chalking up another point to the Brixton bombers.  Thus, the deciding match saw Larry Mathews and Ian Harkness going into a nip-and-tuck race with Spencer Mason and Keith Newton.  Neither team was able to conjure up a 9-dart finish in their 501 match, but both were flirting with the equally rare 90-dart finish.  
Herne Hill had the slim lead and looked as though they’d have first go at the out-shot; but then Mathews, multiple-Surrey League winner, and undefeated in two years of Flyder Cups stepped up.  A high-scoring dart gave him the out-shot – double seven.  He took brief aim and pulled the trigger.  DOUBLE-SEVENS – very first dart!  The finest player in Flyder Cup history had produced its equal finest dart (along with the Trondheim stallion’s master-stroke from last year), to secure the famous Lord of the Rings tankard.
