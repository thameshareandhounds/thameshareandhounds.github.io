<p class="summary">Despite recent injury woes, self proclaimed “tough guy” Chris Daniels continues to expand his portfolio of extreme running. Not content with a stab at the Vets indoor track champs, the intrepid Mr D turned his legs to stair running at the notorious “Vertical Rush” a time trial race up to the top of Tower 42 in the City of London. He finished an impressive 5th place in a lactic drowning 5 minutes 23 secs, with Hugh Shields also turning in a fairly impressive time of 6 minutes 38 secs.
