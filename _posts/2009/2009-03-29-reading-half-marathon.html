title: "Reading Half Marathon"

<p class="summary">Reading Half Marathon saw a select group of Thames men produce some fine performances. John Macfarlane made the trip from the West Country to lead the way with 21st place in 69:45, followed one place behind by Andy Weir in 70:39. Unfortunately incorrectly recorded in the results, Mark Tuckett also showed good pre-marathon form with 72:31 for 32nd, and it was good to see Chris Wrighton returning to form with 73:04 for 42nd. There were also decent performances from Toby Pearson (73:51), Olly Mytton (77:55), Anthony Doolittle (81:34) and Charles Cooper (85:56).
