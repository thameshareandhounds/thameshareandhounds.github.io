<p class="summary">The sunny weather encouraged a record turnout of over 150 runners for today's race at Wimbledon with eight (and a small one) saltires in action.  Nick Altmann placed second with Ian Higgins, Charles Cooper and Richard Pitt also finishing in the top ten places.  David Symons pushed Lucas around in his new buggy in his race debut coming in just over the 20 minute mark, just ahead of Keith Spacie and Kate Symons with Colin Price making up the TH&H eight.  Over in Richmond Park Toby Pearson made a fine debut to take first place in 16.23 with Fred Croft also in action.</p>
