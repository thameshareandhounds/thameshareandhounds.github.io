title: "Greenbelt Relay"

<p class="summary">David Symons made his debut for the vets only Millennium team this weekend at the Greenbelt Relay along with fellow Thames runners Ian Higgins and Richard Pitt. Each team member ran two 10mile+ relay legs over the weekend in a route roughly following the Greenbelt around London. The evergreen Millennium team rolled back the years to place third overall behind the youngsters from Clapham Chasers and Serpentine and, as is traditional, cracked open the champagne at the end of the race to celebrate another successful race, and a vets course record.</p>
