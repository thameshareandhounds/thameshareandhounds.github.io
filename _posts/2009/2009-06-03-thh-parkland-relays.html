<p class="summary">Wednesday night saw a great turnout for the annual Parkland Relays.  A race report and summary of results appear below, full team results are <a href='documents/parklandteams2009.pdf'>here</a> and individual results <a href='documents/parklandindividual2009.pdf'>here</a>.</p>



            <div class="body">
            There were many fine performances from Thames teams and individuals, particularly from the Ladies, who scored a convincing victory in 50:07, ahead of Hercules Wimbledon (53:25) and Windmilers (55:21). Lucy Mcalister led the way with a superb opening leg of 16:00, the fastest of the day. It was great to see Sonia Oâ€™Sullivan back in action (18:00) on leg 2, and a comfortable victory was rounded off by Julia Bleasdale, who maintained her recent excellent form with a speedy 16:07, the second fastest of the night. The Ladies Vets A team also finished 1st Vets team and 4th overall. The relatively youthful trio of Liz Stavreski (18:13), Denise Harris (18:28) and Joy Mcinnes (19:12) all had excellent runs. The only marginally less youthful Ladies Vets B team also ran extremely well to place 2nd Vets team and 6th overall, courtesy of impressive runs from Rachel Disley (19:38), Anna Garnier (19:09) and Vicki Filsell (19:41). In the mens race, our somewhat randomly selected A team had to give best to Nottingham Old Boys (59:52), who won from Thames A (61:26) and Thames B (64:44). This was a result about which one could be fairly relaxed, bearing in mind that three quarters of the victorious NOBS (their nickname not mine) were on loan from Thames in any event. Nottingham were powered on their way by a superb opening leg from Ben Reynolds (14:46), 3rd fastest on the night. A 2nd leg of somewhat dubious validity was followed by fine runs from Andy Weir (14:56) and Chris Wrightson (15:25). Our boys had not answer to that, but Andy Howse (15:55) and Dave Symons (16:00) both ran well, before Toby Pearson (15:07) turned up the burner at notch or two, and James Mcmullen stole the show with a superb final leg of 14:24, the fastest of the night. The equally randomly assembled B team also ran well to place 3rd overall, with strong runs from Anthony Doolittle (16:24), the fast improving Nick Malynn (15:18), Simon Molden (15:41), and taking time out from his training session, Will Cockerell (17:21).
