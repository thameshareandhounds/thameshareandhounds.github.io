<p class="summary">The local 5km park runs have seen a sprinkling of action from Thames members in recent weeks. The Bushy Park race on Saturday, May 23rd saw Will Cockerell place 3rd in 16:38, with Kate Symons, aided and abetted by Lucas and his buggy, finishing in 25:17.  The Wimbledon race on May 30th saw a cautious but very welcome return to competition from captain elect Nic Gould, the ever consistent Ian Higgins finishing 4th in 18:22. Over at Bushy Park Will Cockerell continued to show signs of a return to form with 2nd place in 16:15. On Saturday, June 6th at Wimbledon, Nic Gould ran a steady but improving 20:40, with Kate Symons (21:45) and a presumably buggied up Dave Symons (22:38) also present. It was also good to see fellow new mum Lorna Celiku back in competitive action (27:26).
