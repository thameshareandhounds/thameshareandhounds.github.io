title: "Maureen wins in the summer"

<p class="summary">Well done to Maureen Poole who strode to victory with her best performance in many years.  Vicki, Fiona and Keith were also the bookmakers favourites, but just failed to clinch the tankard.  Simon Molden was fastest over the course, just ahead of Will Cockerell.  Liz Stavreski had a cracking run to take first lady and it was also good to welcome John Skillbeck and Danny Clarke-Lowes back to the Common.  Results below.</p>
