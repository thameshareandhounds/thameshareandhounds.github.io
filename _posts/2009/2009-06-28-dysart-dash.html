<p class="summary">Stuart Major led home the field and a select group of Thames runners with a fine victory to take the Surrey 10k title. Andy Weir was a close second, with a welcome return to the Saltire for Simon Baines in 7th. Team honours also went to the men with Nick Altmann completing our Surrey qualified team. For the ladies, Liz Stavreski put in another good performance to take Surrey Bronze and Anna Garnier took the first V45 prize. Full results below, handicap calculation still to come.</p>
