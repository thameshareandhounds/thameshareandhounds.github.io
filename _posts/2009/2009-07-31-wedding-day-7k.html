<p class="summary">The Thames ladies took centre stage at the ever popular Wedding Day race in Busy Park on Friday. Benita Johnson won the ladies race, finishing an excellent 8th overall. We also took the team prize for the ladies with new member Denise Harris and our new Ladies' captain Anna Garnier completing the team. For the men, Stuart Major led the way in 4th, followed in by a number of strong runs not far behind. Sadly we were just pipped by Ranelagh to the team prize.</p>
