title: "Cross Country vs Kingston & Poly"
---

<p class="summary">A select group of three Thamesmen ran out in this Kingston and Poly race from Sheen Cross. We didn't have enough to warrant a scoring contest, but enjoyed the beautiful conditions in the Park and excellent organisation by our hosts. Our own 2nd claimer Andy Arbour led the field home in impressive fashion to secure yet another K&P championship title.</p>
