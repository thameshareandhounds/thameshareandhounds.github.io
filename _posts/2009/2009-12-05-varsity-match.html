<p class="summary">Against pre-match expectations, the Dark Blues secured a double victory in the annual ‘Varsity Cross-Country Races.</p>



            <div class="body">
            The 34th ladies’ race began with Cambridge’s hopes of registering their first win since 2006 being boosted by the withdrawal of Oxford’s two most experienced runners. In the early stages, it looked as if these hopes would be fulfilled with Naomi Taschimowitz and fresher Amanda Scott taking the lead and the main body of the Light Blue team packed in the middle order.

However, as the course flattened out towards the half-way point, it was the Dark Blues who started to emerge ominously with Michelle Sikes, last year’s winner, moving into second and solid support forming behind her, which picked off the Cambridge runners and crucially relegated their fourth scorer to 10th. With Oxford holding a narrow advantage as the runners hit the heavy mud of the last mile, the result was still in doubt. However, the Dark Blues’ strong team work mean that they were able to hold their positions and secure a 17 points to 21 victory and a 21-13 overall series lead.

Buoyed by their ladies’ performance, the youthful, but talented, Oxford gentlemen’s team produced an outstanding performance to take the honours in the 119th race of their series. Prior expectations had been that Cambridge’s more experienced team might just have the edge over the very wet 7½ mile course.

However, with last year’s first two, Richard Franzese and David Bruce, once again making the running, accompanied by team-mate, Andrew Heyes, and experienced Light Blues, James Kelly, Oxford has a strong presence at the front of the race from the off.

Behind them, and emulating their ladies’ team, they were backed-up by good support work, in particular, with impressive performances from the freshers Jake Shelley and Luke Caldwell.

By the time the runners headed out to Parkside, just after half-way, they were 20 points up and it appeared that only misfortune could deny them. However, it was to be their day and with Andrew Heyes pulling away from Kelly in the closing stages, they were able to secure a 1-2-3 and a 28 points to 52 victory. The individual honours were taken by David Bruce in a fine time of 38:02. This win pushed the Dark Blues back into the lead in the overall series by 60 wins to 59.

Earlier in the day, Oxford also secured a victory in the Old Blues’ Race with last year’s captain, Ian Kimpton, leading them home to a 98-165 scoreline.
