<p class="summary">Thames once again just missed out on medals in the M40, while the 50s performed strongly.  In the 40s it was a question of near, but not quite.  Harkers got the team off to a stunning 15.05 start, progress maintained by Dave Symons.  Matt Lynas maintained strong position before Ben blasted us back into an optimistic second with 15.01.  Al Kennis was a late draft into the team, shrugging off the prospect of fatherhood and then it was left to Andy Weir to lift us back to 4th with 15.26 and Andy Howse and Yobbs to see us home.  The 50s team was also subject to a couple of late fitness tests, and Mike Farmery, Richard Pitt and Jerry Watson all performed strongly.  Results below</p>
