title: Supreme leader wins the handicap
---

<p class="summary">As the new president, John Bryant followed in the footsteps of Kim Jong-il by winning the summer handicap with a glorious piece of front running.  Our dear leader held off valiant efforts of Dorchie, Claire and Dave Walsh, but was never headed over the course.  Simon Molden was fastest overall.  All worked up a good thirst for an excellent summer party at the Leathes in the evening.</p>
