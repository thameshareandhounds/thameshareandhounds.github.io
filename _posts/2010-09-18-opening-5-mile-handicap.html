title: Opening 5 mile handicap
---

<p class="summary">Dave Alcock and Liz Stavreski were fastest over the course on a beautiful late summer day.  But congratulations to Jeff Armitage who took home the handicap trophy.  The handicapers have some work to do given that this is now the second time Jeff has won a trophy in his 18 years of Thames membership.  Just behind Jeff were Kate Symons, Nic Gould and Doug Justins.  Results below.</p>
