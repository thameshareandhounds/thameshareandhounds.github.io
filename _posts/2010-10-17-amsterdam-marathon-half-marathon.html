<p class="summary">A number of Thames men and women joined men's Captain Nic Gould in Amsterdam for a belated birthday celebration.  The Captain's full report is awaited, but earlier indications are of an impressive third ladies spot for Liz Straveski in the half with 1:23:09, and a sub 2:30 performance for Dave Alcock in the marathon.</p>
