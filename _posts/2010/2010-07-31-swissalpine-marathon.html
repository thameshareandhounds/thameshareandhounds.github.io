<p class="summary">David Symons made a first forray into long distance mountain running with a 7hr 40 clocking for the 78km Davos mountain marthon.  Nat Macfarlane ran well in the half marathon race while Jonny opted to enjoy the view rather than go for broke over the 42km course.  Second claim, Huw Lobb however indicated that he's getting back to fitness with victory in the 42k.  At the shorter end, Lucas Symons ran his first race with a 9m 40s clocking for the 0.5km race. </p>
