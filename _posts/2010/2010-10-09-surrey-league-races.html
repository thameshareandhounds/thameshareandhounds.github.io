<p class="summary">Both our ladies and mens team got off to an excellent start to defending the Surrey League titles with both teams taking second place. The Ladies were led home by fine debuts from Ruth Clifton and Clare Donovan and just pipped HHH to second place behind the winners SLH. For the men it was the quartet of Phill Sly, Neil Chisholm, John McFarlane and Stuart Major near the front helping us to finish 2nd, just 5 points behind HHH. Full mens results can be found <a href="http://www.belgraveharriers.com/results/archive.htm">here</a> and the Ladies results <a href="http://www.ranelagh-harriers.com/results2/101009fc.html">here</a> (team and link to full results at bottom of page).</p>
