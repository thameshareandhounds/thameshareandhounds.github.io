<p class="summary">In dire conditions, with race distances reduced for safety reasons, Ruth Clifton powered her way through the mud to a top 50 finish in the 6k ladies race. She was ably backed up by Claire Day, Emily Hogg and Vikki Filsell to close the team in a creditable 21st position.

The half mens team was led by Gordon Pearce in 274th, with the Captain not far behind and Jerry Watson showing his 'National' experience placing just outside the top 400.</p>
