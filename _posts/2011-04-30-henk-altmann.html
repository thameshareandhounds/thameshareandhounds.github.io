<p class="summary">It is with regret that we have to report the death of Henk Altmann on 21st April, peacefully at his home in Wantage after a long battle with gastric cancer.</p>



            <div class="body">
            A member of Thames since 1971, as well as having been a regular competitor for the club many of you may know him from the uniquely Thames social activities such as the Spring Wine Party and the Outlying Run, events for which he always retained a great enthusiasm. <p>

His funeral will be held at Oxford Crematorium at 10.30am on Friday 6th May (postcode OX3 9RZ).  Afterwards there will be light refreshments at nearby Studley Wood Golf Club (OX33 1BF).  In lieu of flowers, donations would be welcome to Macmillian Cancer Support or Marie Curie Cancer Care.  Thames members would be welcome to attend. If you plan to be there it would help the family if you let them know by contacting Mrs Carol Altmann (1 Charlton Gardens, Wantage OX12 8EL), or Nick (nick_altmann@yahoo.co.uk).
