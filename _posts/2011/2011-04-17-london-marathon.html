<p class="summary">Ben Reynolds led the way for Thames in warm conditions placing 2nd M45 and well inside the top 100 overall. Captain Nic Gould was second man home with a strong debut run and Gordon Pearce improved by 2 minutes from last year to be our third man home. Charlotte Saunders flew the flag for the Thames ladies whilst Jeffrey Gordon continued his amazing ever-present record in the event. Thames results that I can get from the website are below, more possibly to follow. Let me know if I've missed you!</p>
