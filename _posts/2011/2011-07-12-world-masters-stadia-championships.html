<p class="summary">Ben Reynolds secured a bronze medal in the V45 5,000m in the World Masters' Championships in Sacramento, California
</p>



            <div class="body">
            Ben reports that he lost out to a Spaniard and Russian in a last lap sprint, finishing in 15:27.94.</br>
He was reasonably pleased with the results given the usual extenuating circumstances (hot, windy, jet lag, getting too old, no speed left, etc).</br>
