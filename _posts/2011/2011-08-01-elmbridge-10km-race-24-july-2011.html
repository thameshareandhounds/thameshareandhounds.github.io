title: "Elmbridge 10km Race - 24 July 2011"
---

<p class="summary">Five Saltires were in action in the Elmbridge 10km race in 24 July. Congratulation to our new vice-captain, Matt Jones, who finished in an impressive third place.  It was a family affair as brother, Stevhen Jones, took the Quentin Clough handicap, ahead of Matt and Lilly Griffiths.</p>
