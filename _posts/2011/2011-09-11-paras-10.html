            Chris reports that he took on the cream of the current Parachute Regiment, racing 1,600 people all with 35lbs rucksacks and military boots over a “cheekily undulating” route that is part of the P-Company Para selection course in Catterick.<br>
Chris proved that a diet of corporate lunches and dinners is as good as professional training by coming home first. Full results can be found <a href="http://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/Paras10/635">here.</a><br>
