title: "Norfolk Coast Ultra (100 km)"
---

<p class="summary">Ed Catmur continued his ultra-running exploits with first place in the Norfolk Coast Ultra 100km race. His time was 9:13.<br>
Ed reports that conditions were fairly pleasant. There was a bit of a headwind for the early beach section, which made the shingle even more unpleasant, but it calmed down later on. Unfortunately, this mean no tailwind for the return leg.</p>
