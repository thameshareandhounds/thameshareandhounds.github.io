<p class="summary">Fantastic runs from Lucy McAlister and Ruth Clifton, finishing 1st and 4th, and fine runs from the other thirteen other Thames ladies in action saw Thames take joint first spot for the match with SLH.  Well done to everyone who ran.  From our first scorer to our final scorer, our results showed our strength and depth.  Our A team, B team and C team now all top the league with two fixtures remaining.
