<p class="summary">12 assorted Thames men and ladies raced well on a chilly and windy evening. Some good results but we did not retain our team trophies but we will put this right in 2013 surely!  Results as follows:

            <div class="body">
            Nick and Claire were first bride and groom.  Sadly Annette was injured in her warm-up so she and Nic could not give the winners any tough competition!  Mike Farmery was 1st Vet 60 and Antonia was 2nd lady.  Congratulations and welcome to Izabela Przekop who made her debut for THH and has been coming regularly on Wednesday nights.  Well done to everyone who made the effort to run.  Bad traffic prevented from Pippa and Stuart Major from getting to the start line and this would have made a difference to the team results!
