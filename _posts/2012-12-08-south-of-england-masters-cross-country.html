---

<p class="summary">Ben Reynolds won the South of England Masters' Cross-Country at Claybury, with Andy Weir 10th (and third in the V45 age group).<br>
Sadly, Andy Morgan-Lee unfortunately went off course when leading comfortably, so was denied the individual honours and a team medal for Thames.</p>
