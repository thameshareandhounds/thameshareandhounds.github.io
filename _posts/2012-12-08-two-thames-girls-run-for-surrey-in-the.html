            <div class="body">
            Ruth Clifton and Claire Day were both selecting for a winning Surrey team in the Inter Counties.  On a very muddy and twisty-turney course, with some demanding little hills, Ruth finished a brilliant 4th and Claire 27th.  Robin Dickson had a great team of girls and as usual, had done an inspired job coaching and selecting.  Georgie Bruinvels (AFD) won convincingly, powering up the final muddy hill to the finish line.
