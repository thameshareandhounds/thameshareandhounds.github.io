<p class="summary">In hot and sunny conditions, and with London looking her very best, our ladies ran extremely well in the London BUPA 10k today. The team finished in 20th position against some very tough opposition and were able to enjoy the wonderful facilities of the British Academy for changing before and after the race.<br>
