title: Ruth Clifton selected for Surrey in Inter-Counties at Cofton Park
---

<p class="summary">On Saturday Ruth ran for the Surrey Team at Cofton Park, Birmingham.  The commentator told us that conditions were the muddiest ever.  We must ask Ruth whether it did rival Parliament Hill. I spotted Ruth running very well amongst some ace lady runners. The Surrey Team of which Ruth was an important member, finished in a very close Silver Medal position with just 151 points to Hampshire's 154.  They were well ahead of Yorkshire on 190.  </p>



            <div class="body">
            This great run by Ruth finished her wonderful cross-country season. Ruth was the top Surrey League runner along with our ladies' team who also finished in top position for the fourth year running.  Many congratulations to Ruth for gaining her place in the Surrey County Team.  We also wish her and Charlie good wishes and a fabulous wedding which is happening very soon.<br>
