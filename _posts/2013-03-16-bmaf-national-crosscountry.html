title: BMAF National Cross-Country Championships, Sunderland
---

<p class="summary">Ben Reynolds made the long trek to Sunderland to defend his BMAF V45 cross-country title.  He duly did so, finishing 2nd in the overall race to a V35 from Tipton. Ben reports that the course was on a different bit of the park from  where the National was run, and not so muddy.</p>
