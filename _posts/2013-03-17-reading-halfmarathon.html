<p class="summary">Four Saltires were in action at the Reading Half-Marathon. Will Mackay - running in the colours of Bedford & County - ran excellently to finish 20th. Not far behind was Simon Wurr, clocking a time just 2 seconds outside his personal best. Toby Pearson and Anthony Doolittle crossed the line in quick succession a little further back.  </p>
