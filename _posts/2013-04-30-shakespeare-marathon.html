<p class="summary">Simon Wurr makes his debut at the marathon distance</p>



            <div class="body">
            The Shakespeare marathon took place in Stratford-upon-Avon and Simon Wurr tried the distance on the road for the first time.  Simon put in a negative split by just over 2 minutes and won the race in 2hr 40:51.  Having seen Simon yesterday he looked as fresh as a daisy so I have the feeling there is a lot more to come at this new distance.
