<p class="summary">A huge congratulations to our Mens V35-45+ Road Relay team, who took Gold and a new course record of 2:06:56 in the BMAF National Road Relays on Saturday.  Such was the level of class involved in this crack squad, I believe that a selection race was employed beforehand.

            <div class="body">
            Ian Harkness finished the first leg in 9th in 15.44, and this was quickly brought up to 6th by Chris Daniels on 2nd leg (16.11).  Andy Weir continued to battle through to 2nd place in 16.05 on leg 3, followed by Ben Reynolds who took the lead by nearly a minute by the end of leg four (15.37).  From there the lead was never lost and the winning margin was merely extended.  First by Brian Thursby-Pelham on 5th (16.12); John McFarlane (15.57); Matt Jones then ran the fastest Thames time of the day of 15.31.  Simon Wurr closed the day with a 15.39 and a resulting lead of over two and a half minutes on Preston Harriers.

I am also pleased to report that our Men's V65 team, consisting of Keith Spacie, Robin Dickson and Michael Johnson finished in 12th place in 1:11:57.
