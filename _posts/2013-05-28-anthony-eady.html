<p class="summary">We are sorry to report that Anthony died on Saturday 25th May, aged 73.<br>
Anthony joined Thames in 1957 and was a very constant member for many years and rarely missed an important Club event. He was always more comfortable as a road runner than over the country and indeed ran in road races for Orion Harriers in the days before Thames was officially registered with SCAAA as a road running club. For twenty five years (1960-84), he organised the Thames Old Boys" race as it was then known.
