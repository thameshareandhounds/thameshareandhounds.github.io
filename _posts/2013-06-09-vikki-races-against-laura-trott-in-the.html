title: VIKKI races against LAURA TROTT in the IG NOCTURNE ELITE RACE
---

<p class="summary">The IG Nocturne Cycle races took place at Smithfield Market last night.  VIkki Filsell put in an awesome ride around the tight circuit in a fierce race of Olympic lady riders.</p>



            <div class="body">
            Vikki's talent never ceases to impress me.  Up there with the thrusters, on a tough tight course, Vikki cycled so fast I could not get a photograph of her.  A complete blurr of speed and skill.  This race was won by Laura Trott of Olympic Gold Medal fame and Vikki finished 46th out of 57.  These are the top cyclists and shows that Vikki is a force to be reckoned with!    Roll on the Cross Country Season.
