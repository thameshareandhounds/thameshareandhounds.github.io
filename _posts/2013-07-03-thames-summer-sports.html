<p class="summary">Under a surprisingly hot sun the revival of the Summer Sports provided dramatic moments aplenty. </p>



            <div class="body">
            The throwing of the Wellington boot show there are plenty of ways to skin a cat, and Dave Symons and Annette Gould had their own private duel by managing to hurl the boot backward into the crowd. In the final round John Clark just out-gunned Will Cockerell.
<p/>

The walking race was a grim slugfest between the cigar-chomping Clark, long-time leader Annette and Nick Altmann. The half-mile battle was only decided in the last 50 yards with JC striding to gold.
<p/>

The Captain won the Ladies' sprint race.  Her reward was the Christine Keeler Cup, for the receipt of which she re-created the same's famous pose in a deck chair.
<p/>

In the Men's race, John Clark completed a stunning hat-trick, but Al Irvine was awarded the Dr Who Time Traveller's Trophy for the fastest Vet, just out sprinting Jeffrey Gordon. 
<p/>

The Children's 400m race was the thriller of the day, and as a rampant Matthew Irvine was set off some 75 yards after the main pack, the Clark twins were held back for another 50 yards by the militant handicapper.  Matthew duly caught the pack at 250; but with still 150 to go, he was tiring and the girls scented blood. At the frantic urgings of the crowd Matthew found gear five just in time and crossed the line with two ticks to spare.
<p/>

Nick Altmann and Claire Day took an early lead in the highly anticipated wheelbarrow race until Nick collapsed a couple of meters from the finish.  Nic and Annette managed to catch up, only for Nick to revive himself to take the win with Claire for the Lady Chatterley Cup.
<p/>

The great swag bag relay, trying to drink a can of lager and then run 100m carrying a sack, separated the wheat from the hops.  It was all square going into the anchor leg, only for the men's captain to hand a severe lesson to Claire in the skills of this particular task.
<p/>

The tug of war over Beverely Brook was atmospheric and hard-fought, with the losing team on top for most of the first half, only for the eventual winners to find various trees and roots with which to use for leverage. The losing team threw in the rope before being dragged into the slimy depths.
<p/>
Thanks to everyone who came along and made this afternoon so fun.  THH summer sports shall return in 2014!
