            <div class="body">
            Ed Catmur as an individual and Simon Wurr paired with Tom Samuel won  this double-marathon at the weekend up in the Lakes.  They might have missed the most amazing tennis match ever but their results are awesome as well!  Many congratulations to the three of you.
