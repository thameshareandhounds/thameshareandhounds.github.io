<p class="summary">Joanna Shillington runs well to take 8th spot in this annual event.</p>

            Well done to Joanna for flying the saltire. We normally have quite a few ladies running in this fun event in Surrey but with the outgoing captain injured and Maureen Poole too,  neither of them were able to keep Joanna company.
