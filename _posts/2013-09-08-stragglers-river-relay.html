title: Stragglers River Relay

<p class="summary">Well done to Claire Day, Vikki Filsell, Will Cockerell, David Jenkins and Liz Stavreski who took part in the Stragglers River Relay marathon from Virginia Water to Ham Lands today.  They finished a very credible 14th team out of 39 in 3:08,  and would have been 4 minutes and 2 places higher had it not been for Will skim reading the key detailed route instructions and heading the wrong direction at an unmarked T junction!</p>
