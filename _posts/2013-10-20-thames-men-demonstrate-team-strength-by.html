title: Thames Men demonstrate team strength by finishing a close 2nd place to Kent in the Surrey League
---

<p class="summary">Despite Kent having six of their top runners in the dozen; Thames men showed them that they are going to have a tough battle on their hands by packing superbly to close in 32, and only coming 2nd to Kent by 16 points (219 to 203).  This must surely have been one of our best team performances in the league to date.<br>
James McMullen took the race out as hard as he could from the start and led to the top of the first main climb, as he said ‘to make Kent really work for their win’, and finished in a fine 5th place.  He was supported by Richard Kowenicki in 8th.  Ben Reynolds was 3rd Vet in 18th; followed by Gordon Pearce (21st); Martin Shore (23rd); Dave Alcock (26th); Ed Catmur (27th); Martin Bishop (28th); Simon Wurr (31st); and Brian Thursby-Pelham in 32nd.  Such was the level of class in this men’s team, some of our top runners didn’t make the top ten scorers.  Many congratulations to everyone who ran. <br>
