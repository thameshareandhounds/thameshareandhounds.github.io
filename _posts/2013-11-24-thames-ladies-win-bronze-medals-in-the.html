title: Thames Ladies win Bronze medals in the South of the Thames 5 miles
---

<p class="summary">Herne Hill hosted the South of the Thames 5 miles, using every inch of Streatham Common to provide a stretching and scenic route.  It was a refreshing change for the Men and Ladies to run together, with the Ladies running well to pick up Bronze medals.  They were just 8 points behind SLH, with Belgrave in 1st place.  Claire Day was 7th (34:42); Liz Stavreski 10th (35:20); Dorchie Cockerell 15th (35:58); Anna Garnier 26th (38:47); and Vikki Filsell in 31st (39:15).<br>
The Thames men were just short of one man on the day for the four to score race, but Gordon Pearce ran well to finish 13th (29:15); Andy Weir in 48th (32:05); and Ollie Brodwick-Ward in 67th (33:11).  However, we would have been hard pushed to beat Kent AC, who once again showed their strength by finishing in 2nd, 4th, 5th and 12th.
