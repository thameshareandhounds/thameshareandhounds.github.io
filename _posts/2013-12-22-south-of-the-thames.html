<p class="summary">Thames battled hard in extremely wet and muddy conditions, over a course that was considerably longer than the advertised 7.5 miles, on Wimbledon Common on Saturday afternoon.  A particular congratulations to Claire Day who finished 3rd overall, and to the Ladies' team who finished 4th, just 5 points shy of medals and 6 points shy of silver.  With Liz Stavreski in 14th; Annette Gould in 29th; Vikki Filsell in 35th; Laura Fidler 36th; Ellie Dorman 44th and Anna Garnier in 48th.<br>
The men were sadly one runner short of a team, but there were good runs from Brian Thursby-Pelham, sporting a particularly tight Thames vest, in 38th; Nic Gould also ran well to finish 43rd, and Chris Daniels in 94th.  New comers Martin Dunlop and David Rees did well to finish 115th and 133rd respectively.  </p>
