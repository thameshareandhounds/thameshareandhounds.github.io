title: "SURREY CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS at Lloyd Park"

<p class="summary">Ruth skims across the mud with a superb run to finish in silver medal position behind on-form Georgie Bruinvels and our THH Ladies team finish 4 points behind a speedy Herne Hill Ladies team</p>



            <div class="body">
            Only shortly after New Year and Christmas, Ruth clearly has not over indulged and neither have the rest of the THH Ladies squad.  Everyone ran brilliantly today over a very muddy and testing Lloyd Park 2-lap 5 mile course in their usual attacking styles. On our warm-up we checked out whether we should go for 15mm or 12mm spikes.  The sharp little hill in the middle of the course was particularly tough and sticky.  After that was over the rest seemed not exactly easy, but the worst was definitely over (there were two laps though!)  I was not near the front so I could not tell how our leading runners were getting on....  The results were pinned up and annoyingly to be beaten by just 4 points and to lose last year's crown might have been disappointing but everyone should be proud of the way they ran.  We'll be back at the Surrey League next Saturday to do better!!!  Mitcham Common here we come.
