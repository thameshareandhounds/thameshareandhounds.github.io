title: "THE MOST AMAZING SPRINT FINISH ..............EVER"

<p class="summary">LADIES SURREY LEAGUE Ruth puts in incredible sprint that had all the audience and supporters totally engaged, and screaming themselves ragged.</p>



            <div class="body">
            At the third fixture of the Ladies' Surrey League held for the first time at Mitcham Common (courtesy of Clapham Chasers) where the course included at least 9 sharp hills, Ruth ran the most tactical race.  Ruth was determined to put wrong to right.  That meant beating Tish Jones (Belgrave) although Ruth did beat her at the South of the Thames but over the longer distance of 7.5 miles.  Hanging on to Tish until the final muddy and slippery downhill, Ruth then went for it and left Tish struggling to keep the pace, and  going on to win by 2 exciting seconds.  The Thames Ladies were short of a few of their speedier runners but nevertheless those who represented the club, ran their hearts out and we finished just 2 points behind Belgrave in 3rd place, with Dulwich winning with a very strong team.  We are still in the lead by a narrow 38 points.  This means a build-up to get the best possible squad out for an increasingly tense final at Denbies Vineyard on Saturday 9th February.  This is not to be missed!  We are the holders for the 3rd year running and we do not want to give up our title lightly.<p>
