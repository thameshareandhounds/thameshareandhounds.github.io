<p class="summary">The Thames men’s team ran well to finish six overall and second in the “non-university team” category, behind the overall winners, the RAF. The team was a fine mix of age (Andy Robinson and the captain) and youth (Robin Brown and Alex Young) and performances throughout were very consistent, with only 36 seconds separating the fastest and slowest legs. However, mention must go to Andy, who set the tone on leg one in 19.04 and Alex – making a fine debut in a Saltire – who ran 19.16 on leg 3, having already run a leg for CUH&H and still recovering from the CUH&H Boundary Run the previous weekend.<br>
Just behind the Thames team was a three-parts Thames, one-part Ranelagh OUCCC Old Gits team including Andy and the captain (running second legs), Andy Arbour and Pete Haarer. An OUCCC Old Gits mixed team including new member, Maire Gorman, finished sixth in the mixed category.
