title: "King's Head Reunion"
---

<p class="summary">In August 1975, the Great Fire of Thames destroyed our headquarters, heritage and hip-baths at the King's Head in Roehampton. On Saturday, a dwindling group of veteran Thames men returned, pilgrim-like, to the freshly-opened King's Head.<br>
<br> 
The criteria for this select band was that they had savoured the joys of the hip bath; that they had clambered up the steep stairs to the old changing rooms; and that they could still walk or run a mile or three on the rain sodden grass of the Common.<br>
<br> 
The group, which was prodded into action by Jeremy Denny and included (through the years) three Presidents, two Captains, four vice-Captains, a Treasurer, a Secretary and a handful of handicappers, paid a rather creaky homage to a century of memories enshrined in this inn that was the cradle of cross-country running.<br>
