<p class="summary">The fine quartet of Ruth Wallace, Claire Day, Annette Gould and Vikki Filsell picked up a team Gold medal at the Surrey Road Relays yesterday for being the fastest Surrey qualified Senior Ladies' team (and second overall behind Belgrave Harriers).  Ruth also ran the third overall fastest time of 17:09.<br>
The Senior Men's team consisting of Gordon Pearce, Nic Gould, Andy Robinson, Richard Kowenicki, Dave Alcock, and James McMullen pulled off a fantastic race, winning by over 40 seconds from Clapham Chasers. With James running the third overall fastest time of the day in 14:29.<br>  Unfortunately, it turned out that Richard's residence in Westminster does not quite come within the Surrey boundary - so there were no Surrey Gold Medals for the team.<br>
