title: "Ladies' Surrey League in Lightwater Country Park"

<p class="summary">Despite not having all of our best runners out, the Thames Ladies' came 5th overall in 151 points.  We were in fact only a few points behind Clapham, Herne Hill and Dulwich in front of us, so we are in a very strong position going into the next race.  It was fantastic to have Julia Bleasdale in the team, who put on an impressive show to win by nearly a minute from Belgrave's Tish Jones.  Liz Stavreski did very well to come 25th, although nursing a sore calf.  Dorchie Cockerell was 31st, Emily Hogg - running in her first race after having Alice, scored a fine 37th.  Annette Gould was then 57th, a mere week after completing a Marathon.  Our B team, consisting of Anna Garnier, Clare Sylvester, Jessica Davies, Rachael Davies and Joanna Winn-Smith, also ran well to come 5th.  </p>
