title: "The OMM (Original Mountain Marathon)"
---

<p class="summary">Hot off the press, the OMM (Original Mountain Marathon) results are just in, and yet again, several THH runners were action in challenging conditions in the Brecon Beacons. The OMM is a 2-day event where competitors compete in pairs, carrying all the kit they need for 36 hours (tent, food, sleeping bags etc etc) and the courses consist of navigating your way across open, bleak and challenging mountainous terrain. This yearâ€™s event took place in the Brecon Beacons, and the high winds and heavy showers made for testing conditions.<br>
Ed Catmur was a sensational 4th in the Elite competition with his final time after 2 days only 20 mins off the leaders. <br>
Simon Wurr and former THH member Mark Tuckett were 2nd in the A Class. Beaten by a pair of GB orienteers / fell runners on day one, they fought back to record the fastest time on day two.<br>
Richard Kowenicki and Tom Samuel had a magnificent weekend, finishing in the top three on both days and ended up a clear 2nd in the B Class.<br>
Andy N. Robinson (SLOW) also had a good weekend and was 19th on the Medium score.</p>
