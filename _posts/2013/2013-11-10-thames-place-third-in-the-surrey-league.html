title: "Thames Place Third in the Surrey League in a High Quality Field"
---

<p class="summary">Despite some heavy rain earlier in the day making the conditions underfoot quite slippery, Kent AC proved that they are going to be hard to beat this year, with top level packing putting 5 of their best in the top ten.  Herne Hill Harriers also packed heavily, with 7 of their team in the top 30.  Thames fought hard in this high quality race, only finishing 42 points off Herne Hill, and actually closing our 10th man in 45th - better than both Kent and Herne Hill and proving what a strong team we have this year.<br>
Thames also retained our second place in the league overall behind Kent AC, but only ten points in front of Herne Hill.  We therefore have everything to fight for in the next league fixture which is going to be at home, so hopefully that will give us an advantage.<br>
