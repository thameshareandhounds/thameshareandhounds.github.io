title: "Thames Ladies take Bronze in the London Cross-Country Championships"
---

<p class="summary">For the first time, Thames took to Parliament Hill on Saturday to take part in the London Cross-Country Championships.  The course was as tough as ever, but the Ladies ran exceptionally well to take the Bronze medal behind Highgate and London Heathside, also beating our Surrey League rivals Dulwich.  In the scoring four were Claire Day in 9th; Ruth Wallace in 18th; Dorchie Cockerell in 27th and Liz Stavreski in 31st.  Anna Garnier and Vikki Filsell played a key supporting role in 57th and 60th place.<br>
In a four to score race the men again showed superb packing, with Martin shore in 18th; Gordon Pearce in 21st; Martin Bishop in 26th and Nic Gould in 27th.  They were supported by Brian Thursby-Pelhan in 44th; John Clark in 59th; and Ollie Brodwick-Ward in 101st.  Sadly we just missed out on Bronze medals by a mere 5 points to Hercules Wimbledon.  But we were 32 points well clear of our Surrey League Rivals Herne Hill.<br>
