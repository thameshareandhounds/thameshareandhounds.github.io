title: "Thames Ladies move up to Third Overall in the Surrey League"
---

<p class="summary">The Thames Ladies fielded a strong team of 11 runners for our 2nd Surrey League of the season on Farthing Downs.  It was certainly smiles for everyone after a tough race in Happy Valley as our A team came 3rd overall in 121 points, only just behind Herne Hill in 92 points.  With Claire Day running very well to finish 8th; Liz Stavreski 14th; Ruth Wallace 17th; Jo Davies 39th and Pippa Major 43rd.  The B team results have not yet been confirmed, but it does look like we might have come out on top, with Annette Gould in 45th; Emily Hogg (48th); Clare Sylvester (54th); Vikki Filsell (64th); Jess Davies (106th); and Maureen Poole in 138th. <br>
This means that we have moved up to 3rd overall in the league, only 62 points behind Herne Hill.  We therefore have everything to play for at our home fixture in January.<br>
