title: A fabulous 5th place finish for the Thames men in the South of England Cross-Country Championships
---

<p class="summary">Mud, mud glorious mud!  Conditions at Parliament Hill were seasonally gloopy, including a few sections where I’m sure I sunk in to at least mid-calf level, making it one of the toughest cross-country races on the calendar.  This meant that Thames were in their element, with the men’s team finishing 5th place overall, just two points shy of AFD in 4th, and well in front of our Surrey League rivals Kent AC and Herne Hill.  Simon Wurr had an outstanding run on the 3-lap 9.3 mile course, finishing 28th.  Ben Reynolds’ legend only ever grows, with a 54th place finish.  Martin Bishop also had a very strong run in 69th; followed by Richard Hewitt in 109th; Martin Shore in 116th and Ed Catmur in 127th.  The scoring 6 were well supported by Nic Gould (141st); Nick Altmann (191st); John Clark (201st); Ollie Brodick-Ward (377th); Tom Samuel (445th); Richard Craig-McFeely (576th); and Alun Johns (716th).  Richard Kowenicki unfortunately went over on his ankle after 1.5 miles and had to stop. <br><br>
The Ladies’ team finished a respectable 8th place overall.  We were also clear of our main Surrey League rivals Herne Hill, and beat the Serpentine who had 22 runners out.  Claire Day had a mighty run, finishing 21st.  Dorchie Cockerell was 52nd, Amy Aronson 75th and Jo Davies 83rd.  Supporting the scoring 4 were Anna Garnier in 175th and Jess Davies in 285th.<br><br>
A big thank you to all the runners and to everyone who came out to support in the quagmire.<br><br>
