title: Double Top for Thames in the last Surrey League
---

<p class="summary">It was double victory for Thames in the final Surrey league match.  It was all to play for going into the races, with both the Ladies’ and the Gentlemen’s teams lying 3rd place overall, just a whisker behind Herne Hill Harriers. <br><br>
The Ladies battled hard in the thick mud and biting wind at Lloyd Park to beat the Belles from Belgrave, who have been so dominant this season, with a match winning score of 70.  This compared to Herne Hill’s 130 put us into 2nd place in the overall league rankings by a mere 31 points.  A close battle and a fantastic result, and it really does show you that every runner counts!<br><br>
Claire Day led the Thames girls home in yet another laudable run in 7th place; Dorchie Cockerell and Amy Aronson worked together to finish 14th and 15th; Antonia ran very well to finish in 16th – after just returning to racing from a long spell off with injuries; Jo Davies finished off a superb season with 18th.  We also finished the first B team on the day, with Liz Stavreski (31st); Anna Garnier (55th); Emily Hogg (61st); Clare Slyvester (67th); Laura Fidler (74th); supported by Jess Davies (154th) and Maureen Poole (233rd).<br><br>
The men also put in a tremendous match winning performance on the slightly drier Ranelagh course, beating the current leader Kent AC by 33 points, and our closest rivals Herne Hill Harriers by 144 points.  This put Thames into 2nd place overall, by a mere 83 points, and just 97 points behind the overall winners Kent AC. <br><br>

There were particularly fine runs from James McMullan in 7th; Simon Wurr in 9th and Richard Kowenicki in 10th.  They were closely followed by Howard Bristow in 11th; Martin Bishop in 14th; and Gordon Pearce in 20th.  The rest of the terrific scoring ten were Martin Shore in 28th; Ed Catmur in 32nd; Ben Reynolds in 35th and Brian Thursby-Pelham in 52nd. <br><br>
