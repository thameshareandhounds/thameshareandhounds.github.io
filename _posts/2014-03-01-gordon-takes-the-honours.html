title: Gordon takes the honours
---

<p class="summary">The beautiful spring-like conditions belied the very heavy going on the common for the long distance handicap so it was a day when our speedier members came out on top.  Gordon Pearce went from last to first on the day to win the trophy with Nic and Ed in second and third spot.  New member Daniel came a creditable fourth ahead of Claire who was fastest lady on the day.  Results below.</p>
