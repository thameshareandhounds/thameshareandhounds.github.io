---

<p class="summary">In stark contrast to last year, when the Southern 12 Stage Relay was called off due to snow and ice; this yearâ€™s event was held in glorious warm spring sunshine.  Thames managed a very strong team performance to finish 15th overall, in front of our Surrey League rivals Herne Hill Harriers. <p/>Simon Wurr ran the fastest long stage in the team, with 25:22 on leg 1 (20th  overall); and Ian Harkness also having a fantastic run with the fastest short stage running 16:39 on leg 2 (18th overall).  Nic Gould pulled the team up to 15th (25:51) on leg 3; followed by Jack Blaiklock in 16th (17:39) on leg 4; Martin Bishop 18th in 26:56 on leg 5; Nick Altmann to 16th in 17:07 on leg 6; Martin Shore to 15th in 26:16 on leg 7; Jerry Watson 17th in 18:32 on leg 8; Richard Hewitt 18th in 27:24 on leg 9; John Clark maintained 18th with 17:56 on leg 10; Gordon Pearce pulled the team to 15th in 25:54 on leg 11; and Chris Daniels brought the team home in 15th place  with a 17:31 on the final short stage.<p/>
