title: 10 mile challenge and handicap
---

<p class="summary">Gordon Pearce was quickest over the course, but Ed Catmur ran out winner of the 10 mile handicap.  Run in beautful spring conditions, Ed and Gordon battled head to head until approaching Kingston Gate when Gordon made his bid for victory.  Claire Day ran excellently to be the fastest lady, and it was excellent to see the Lynas's and Steve Pollard in action too.</p>
