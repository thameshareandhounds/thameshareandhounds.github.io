<p class="summary">Congratulations to everyone who ran today.  In a very exciting race, Richard Kowenicki was the first Thames man home in an excellent 2:31:39.  Ben Reynolds yet again showed what a classy runner he is by coming in close behind with a beautifully paced 2:33:53.  He came within 30 seconds of placing in the global top 50 all-time M50 list.  James McMullan paid for a frisky first half, and faded to a respectable 2:34:49.  Brian Thursby-Pelham ran a fine 2:35:03.  They were closely followed by David Symons with 2:41:14 and Nic Gould in 2:41:54.  Simon Wurr suffered from a stitch but valiantly finished with a 2:44:48.  Ed Catmur had a cold but finished with 2:47:42.<br>
Claire Day was the first Thames lady home, running a PB of 2:58:01.   Keeping her in check was Toby Pearson with 2:58:05 and Jerry Watson who ran 2:58:28; also Peter Woodburn just behind with 2:58:35. 
Al Kennis, running for a Charity, finished with 3:32:49, and Alex MacKula ran 3:55:48.<br><br>

Second-claimer Chris Finill defied hamstring problems for nigh on 35km, before his body called time on 33 consecutive sub-3 hour runs, and this year had to settle for a 3:10.  Finally, Jeffrey Gordon did not attempt to continue his magnificent ever-present record ended this year.  I should like to pay tribute to his inspirational achievement.<br><br></p>
