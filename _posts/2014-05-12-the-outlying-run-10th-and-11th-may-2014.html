title: The Outlying Run 10th and 11th May 2014
---

<p class="summary">A wonderful weekend was had by all in Charmouth.  The gale force winds and rain predicted by the weather forecast did not come to pass, and bar a couple of showers the weather was pleasant and made for an enjoyable run.<br> 
A big thank you to Robin Britton for organising such beautiful routes along the coastal path and then inland.  The views on the Jurassic coastal path are simply some of the best in the world and made for a good few excuses to stop; with the climb up the Golden Cap making some of the dinosaurs among us make some very strange noises.  The return run through the bluebell covered lanes was also spectacular.<br>
Thank you to Chris Hutber for organising such a great weekend away.<br><br>  </p>
