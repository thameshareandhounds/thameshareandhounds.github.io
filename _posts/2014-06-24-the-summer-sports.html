title: The Summer Sports
---

<p class="summary">This year the Summer Sports theme was a celebration of Roger Bannister breaking the 4 minute mile.  This highlight of the Thames calendar started off with the Children's handicap half mile.  The youngest participant Daniel Bryant started in front and failed to be caught by any of the field, despite a ferocious endeavor by Seb Cockerell, and took home the Brasher and Chataway cup.<br><br>
The attempt on the 4 minute mile was an extremely exciting affair.  Two teams of 5 took up the challenge as a shuttle relay up and down the 100m straight.  Gordon's team (consisting of Gordon, Will Cockerell, John Clark, Matt Bryant and Alex MacKula) clocked an impressively close 4:02; while the Captain's team (of Andy Robinson, Nic Gould, Ed Catmur, Nick Altmann and Dorchie) was just two seconds behind.<br><br>
The welly throwing again provided an interesting experiment into the various throwing techniques.   John Clark's previously unbeatable backwards over the head method was this year thwarted by Andy Robinson's super spin.  Barney Higgins also managed to out throw Ed Catmur's straight into the ground volley - with much laughter from the crowd. 
The children received a half lap head start in the walking race; with Seb Cockerell proving impossible to catch, so he took home the John Landy trophy.<br><br>
In the final event, Alex MacKula demonstrated his far superior cricketing skills, with his team winning the Norris McWhirter Tem Cup in a match which went down to the final ball.<br><br></p>
