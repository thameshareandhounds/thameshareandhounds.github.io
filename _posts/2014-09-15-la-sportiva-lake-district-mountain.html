title: La Sportiva Lake District Mountain Trial
---

<p class="summary">Ed Catmur placed an excellent 3rd in Sunday’s La Sportiva Lake District Mountain Trial which this year was run from Patterdale over the Hellvellyn range. It was the 60th running of the Mountain Trial, a tough navigational-type fell race. The Classic course was about 25 miles with over 6000 feet of ascent. In the 70s and 80s when it was known as the “Vaux” there was always a good Thames team taking part.<br>
 
The current race organisers are Thames members David and Miriam Rosen. They also ran, but on the “short” course which was still about 15 miles with over 4000 foot of ascent.<br>
 
The previous weekend on Cannock Chase, Miriam won the British Middle Distance Orienteering Championships in the W65 category. And she took silver in the Sprint Orienteering Championships at Keele University.<br>
