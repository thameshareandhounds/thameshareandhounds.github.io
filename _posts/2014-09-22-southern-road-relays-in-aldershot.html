title: Southern Road Relays in Aldershot
---

<p class="summary">Our Senior Men's team was in action at the Southern Road Relays in Aldershot yesterday and finished a solid 33rd out of 72 teams with a total finishing time of 2:01:39.  James McMullan was 25th on leg one in 19:17; followed by Neil Chisholm in 20:34.  It was great to see Simon Baines back in action and he held the team position in 36th with 19:57.  He was followed by Ben Reynolds running 20:40.  Expectant father Nic Gould then ran 21:16 to bring us up to 35th, and Gordon Pearce ran a speedy 19:55 to bring us home in 33rd place.<br>
Sadly our V40 men's team was affected by injury this year, so we were unable to carry on our Gold medal winning streak from the previous few years.<br><br>

Bristol Half Marathon: Well done to Anthony Doolittle who was 133rd in 1:22:29.<br><br></p>
