title: "Thames Ladies Win Silver at the Surrey County Cross-Country Championships"
---

<p class="summary">Thames Ladies had a superb run out at the County Championships at Denbies in Dorking, despite flooding and Somme battlefield like conditions rendering 15 mm spikes a necessity.  Aldershot demonstrated their dominance, by finishing their 4 scorers in the top ten; however we demonstrated our strength by bringing home silver medals with 63 points, well clear of Belgrave in 96.  Claire Day was first home in 9th; Dorchie Cockerell 12th; Amy Aronson in 18th and Liz Stavreski in 24th.   They were ably supported by Anna Garnier and Claire Sylvester who both had a fantastic runs to finish 34th and 49th respectively.  Close behind Annette Gould was 52nd; Vikki Filsell 68th and Kim Bainbridge 76th.<br><br>
The men might have avoided the worst of the downpours, but the previous 8 races made the conditions particularly sloppy.  We just failed to finish a team, but there were very good runs from Martin Bishop in 12th and Martin Shore in 13th.  Brian Thursby-Pelham also ran very well to finish 18th, with John Clark in 57th and Anthony Doolittle in 90th.  <br><br>
A particular thank you to everyone who came to support in the horrible conditions! Full results <a href="http://www.surreyathletics.org.uk/crosscountry/champs/2013/20140104.php">here</a><br><br>
On another note Ben Reynolds finished 16th in the Kent County Champs, assisting Tonbridge to beat Kent AC.<br>
