Liz Stavreski ran 84:24 and was 2nd Lady (1st V40); and Bob Harrison ran 90:44 and finished 44th overall in the Lydd Half Marathon.<br><br>

Despite recent injury problems, Anna Garnier won the 3000m in the V55 category at the BMAF Indoor Champs at Lee Valley.  We wish her the very best of luck at the World Championships in Budapest in a few weeks time.<br><br>
