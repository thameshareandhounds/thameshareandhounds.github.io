title: "Thames V45 Men's team win Bronze Medals at the National Masters' Road Relay Championships "
---

<p class="summary">Thames were busy up at the Mastersâ€™ relay in Birmingham on Saturday.  Unfortunately, Andy Morgan-Lee went over on his ankle and had to pull out at the last minute.  After some difficult decisions about optimum team selection Chris Daniels was promoted to the V45 team and the V35 was left as incomplete.<br><br>
The V45 team did well to finish with a Bronze medal; but with Andy in the team Gold should have been within our grasp.  Ian Harkness ran an excellent first leg in 15:52 coming in 1st V45; he was followed by Chris Daniels who ran 17:02 and coming in 5th.  David Symons put in a good run finishing with a 16:02 and bringing the team up to 3rd.  On the glory leg Ben Reynolds also had an excellent run to maintain 3rd with a 16:02.<br><br>
The V35 team was short of one runner to ensure our V45 was complete, but finished the end of leg 5 in 4th.  So again it is safe to assume that medals might have been possible.  John Clark came home in 16:45 and 17th place on leg 1; Nick Altmann ran the second fastest time on his leg (15:55) and brought the team up to 6th place.  Phil Tedd ran the fastest Thames time of the day (15:23), and was the fastest on his leg by 40 secs, bringing the team up to 3rd place.   Simon Wurr also had a stonking run in 15:49 and brought the team up to and excellent 2nd place.  Andy Howse ran 17:25 and the team finished at the end of leg 5 in 4th place.  It was a case of what might have been, but we certainly have lots of potential for next year.<br><br>
Our V55 team did well to finish in 17th place.  Richard Pitt ran 19:24; followed by Mike Farmery in 20:32 who brought the team up 5 places.  Chris Cheeseman ran the final leg in 20:14 for the team to finish in 17th.<br><br>
