<p class="summary">Despite a forecast of heavy showers the evening weather held for the record 96 teams who took part in this year's event.  A huge thank you to everyone who organised the race and who also helped out on the night.  It was again extremely well received by everyone who took part.<br>
The Thames men pulled out all the stops and fielded a dream team of Richard Kowenicki, Simon Wurr, Gordon Pearce and James McMullan to win by over a minute from The Segment Hunters.  The Nottingham Old Boys (NOBS) came in 3rd, with Andy Weir and Ben Reynolds making up half the team.  The Thames B team was 4th.<br>  Andy Greenleaf impressively recorded the two fastest times; 13:59 for the Segment Hunters, and 14:06 for the NOBS.  Richard Kowenicki was 3rd in 14:13.<br>
Despite having a few of the girls missing on the night, the Thames Ladies' pulled off an unexpected win with the welcome addition of Rosie Davies to the team.  They were certainly helped by Claire Day who ran the fastest time of the day in 17:13.  The B team consisting of Dina Lockwood, Anna Garnier and Claire running again came 14th.<p/>
