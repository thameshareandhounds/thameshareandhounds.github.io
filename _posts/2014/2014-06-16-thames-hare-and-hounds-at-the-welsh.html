title: "Thames Hare and Hounds at the Welsh Castles (7th and 8th June)"
---

<p class="summary">Twenty Saltires plus vital supporters battled the hills and often horrendous weather conditions to finish an excellent 8th overall in the Welsh Castles Relay. New member Clive Lovett was thrown into the deep end in his first Welsh Castles, not only running the opening leg from Caernarfon but also acting as one of the team drivers, ferrying runners and their cars across Wales all the way to Cardiff on Sunday. The worst of the weather on day one affected Clive, Dave Alcock and Matt Lynas who all ran excellently despite the conditions. Things brightened up from there with Andy Howse setting off from Barmouth in glorious sunshine.<br><br>

Day two started with some drama as Nick Altmann and Claire's car stared to smell of burning oil on route to the start, which meant finding an open garage at 7am on a Sunday morning in Wales.  Amazingly they did.  Claire Day went on to win her stage as did Liz Stavreski; Thames also achieved two second places from James McMullan and John Clark. We started where we finished weather wise, with Alex Mackula having to endure a torrential downpour upon his arrival at the finish line in Cardiff. Much of the team were still there to welcome him home though before beating a sharp retreat to dry off for the drive home.<br><br> 

Biggest headache for the captain over the weekend came from Anthony Doolittle who was spotted casually walking through Dolgellau 25 minutes before his leg was due to start ten miles down the road in Dinas Mawddwy! Somehow he made it to the start in time and even managed a brief warm up. Anthony's excuse was that he took a copy of last years instructions since which the stage times had been brought forward 30 minutes.<br><br></p>
