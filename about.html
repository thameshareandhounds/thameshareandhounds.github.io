<h2>About</h2>
<p>Thames Hare and Hounds is a cross country running club based at our clubhouse on Wimbledon Common. Drawing from South West London and beyond our large membership spans all ability of runner. We organise regular training runs and provide a fixture list ranging from low-key handicaps races to championship events. On top of this the year is punctuated with dinners and other less formal social gatherings.</p>

<h3>When we Meet</h3>
<p>The Club meets for regular runs at its headquarters on Wimbledon Common, see below for directions. On Wednesday evenings we meet here at 7.30pm, after which we retire for refreshments at the the Telegraph pub on Putney Heath. Runs tend to last between five and ten miles.

Our other regular run is on Sunday morning departing 10am, where the range is from five to around fifteen miles. We meet at Robin Hood Gate, across the road from our clubhouse in Richmond Park. Please note that this entrance to the Park is not open to vehicles.

Feel free to come along, you will always find someone willing to run at your pace.

A number of Thames runners also do a high quality session at the Kingsmeadow track from 7pm on Tuesday nights, ask one of the contacts at the foot of this page for more details.</p>

<h4>Where we Meet</h4>
<p>Our headquarters building is on the Richardson Evans Memorial Playing Fields, on the edge of Wimbledon Common near the Robin Hood roundabout on the A3. If you are travelling by car then turn left into the playing field car park from the A3 southbound, just before the Robin Hood roundabout. It can also be reached by the number 85 bus from Kingston or Putney. Once there follow the gravel path to the right of the pavilion and look for the door with our saltire logo.

<h4>Competition</h4>
<p>As well as being a diverse and friendly club we are also a successful one. The mens' and ladies teams compete in Surrey League Division One cross-country league. In recent years our mens teams have collected medals in the Southern cross-country championships and road relays at both senior and veteran level.

Mob-matches against other local clubs involve getting as many runners as possible out; since everyone counts the runners at the back are as important as those at the front. The second team enjoys numerous inter-club fixtures throughout the winter months. Regular club handicaps allow the whole club to compete at the same fixture.

While cross-country forms the mainstay of our winter racing, we also field teams in a number of road races, including the London Marathon.</p>

<h4>Benefits of Membership</h4>
<p>As a member you will get to run in up to as many as 30 free races a year. You will also qualify for a club affliation discount on many major road races. See the benefits page here for further store discounts.</p>

<h4>How to Join</h4>
<p>Membership costs just 25 pounds per year which we think is a bargain.

There's no compulsion to join up straight away. If you're local to Wimbledon then come along for a couple of runs and see if you enjoy running with us.

If you're further afield, are coming to the UK for the first time or struggle to make our training times then give us a call. You can still race for us and we'd be pleased to hear from you</p>
