	<h4>This is here to help you make changes to the website!</h4>
	<p>First you will want to make a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account. You will get an email from Github asking you to verify the email address.</p>
	<img src="/img/ScreenShot-1.jpg">
	<p>After you have made an account and are logged in, you will see the home page. You will then need to ask an admin to invite you to the Thames Hare and Hounds repository. An email will be sent to you from github. Follow the instructions given by the email.</p>
	<img src="/img/ScreenShot-2.jpg">
	<p>Once you have accepted the invite, you can then edit the repository. <a href="https://github.com/thameshareandhounds/thameshareandhounds.github.io">Click here</a> to take you to the repository.</p>
	<img src="/img/ScreenShot-3.jpg">
	<p>This is all the code for the website.</p>

	<h4>How to edit an existing page</h4>
	<p>There are two types of pages, permanent ones and posts.  We'll start by making a change to a permanent one.
	</p>

	<p>
	(show selecting the file, clicking the pencil icon, then the commit/save dialogue. Explain that .md is markdown,
	an easy-to-type format, and link to a markdown guide online)
	</p>
	
	<h4>How to a create a new post</h4>
	<p>Click on to _posts. You will see all the current posts. To create a new post click on the + (pluss) icon above all the files. (create under _posts, importance of the file name format...)
	</p>
	<p>You should come to a page that looks like this. The red boxes is where you must fill in information. The first red box<br>
	is where you put the title of the page. You start off with the date like so: 2015-09-23<br> and followed with the title: 2015-09-23-title
	<br>
	After the title you MUST have .md at the end. Md is short for Markdown and is a easy way to style text on your website.<br>
	The next red box is what needs to be at the start of all your posts.<br>
	---<br>
	layout: post<br>
	title: "Title of the page goes here!"<br>
	categories: You choose what goes here<br>
	---<br>
	
	What comes after this is up to you. Here is a website that simpley explains Markdown. <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Click Here</a>
	<br>The last step is to add a description and to make sure that the box on top is checked. Click on Commit new file.

	<h4>Linking to images</h4>
	<p>(link to help; need to agree CSS classes)</p>
	

	<h4>Including results</h4>
	<p>Either a pre tag for now, or use tableizer (link).  Better solution coming soon</p>
	
	<h4>Anything else?</h4>
	<p>Contact one of the technically minded Thames people who have Github access (link to that page), or raise an issue
	on Github</p>
