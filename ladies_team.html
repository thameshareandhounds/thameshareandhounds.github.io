<h2>Ladies' Team</h2>

<p>The club has a thriving Ladies’ team and we are always looking for new members to join us. We compete in all local and regional cross country and road competitions. The focus of our winter season is the Surrey Ladies’ XC League, in which we most recently finished in third place in the ultra-competitive division one competition. Spread over four fixtures from October to February, league races are either 6 or 8km and are held at venues across SW London and Surrey. Whatever your level, these races give you a great opportunity to test yourself against other runners, to be part of a close-knit team and to improve your own running.
As well as cross country we also compete in road running, notably in relay competitions during the autumn and the spring as well as major road races such as the London Marathon.</p>
<p>If you are looking to improve your running, be part of a friendly &amp; competitive team, and take part in regular races then we would love to hear from you. Our joining process is very simple and for a small annual subscription you get free entry to the vast majority of our races. To find out more please contact our Ladies’ Team Captain Annette Gould - <a href="mailto:annettejchase@hotmail.com">annettejchase@hotmail.com</a></p>
