<h2>Men's Team</h2>

<p>The Club takes part in over 40 races from September through to July catering for all levels of ability. At the sharper end the Club takes part (and sometimes wins medals at) a host of local, regional and national level races. The mainstay of the cross-country season is the Surrey League series of 4 of the quickest cross country races in the country. The Club currently competes in Division 1. The Club also enters teams for all County level cross-country races and the flagship Southern and National Championships. In addition the Club contests County road relays and the London Marathon, where we have, on occasion, won the men’s team prize.</p>
<p>In addition the Club participates in a number of challenge matches against other local clubs, some of which go back more than 50 years. The oldest take place against Ranelagh and South London Harriers and are known as Mob Matches at which the aim is to produce the greatest number of runners and the scoring is designed so that the rearmost runner has the greatest impact on the outcome. All are followed by excellent teas.</p>
<p>The club hosts a number of intra-club handicaps, a Dash For Splash 10km cross country race which attracts some 300+ runners, the annual Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match which is preceded by an Old Boys (and Thames runners) race, the alumni race of 300+ runners racing for their former schools and the season closing Parkland Relays, open to all Clubs and the traditional end to the cross-country season.</p>
