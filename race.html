<h4>Alumni Race</h4>

<p>Thames has hosted the popular annual Alumni Race run since 1953. The course of 5 miles on Wimbledon Common is a shortened version of the Blues Race course. All ages are welcome. Seventy year olds compete with eighteen year olds - the fastest time is usually close to 25 mins and the back markers nearer 60 mins.<br>The entry rules are simple : A team of unlimited numbers may enter, but they must all be genuine alumni of the nominated school. Guest runners are welcome - whether partners, friends, parents, staff, current pupils, children, grandchildren - but cannot score as part of your team.<br>There are four competitions within the race:</p>

<li>The open race for The Henry VIII Trophy to be won by the team whose first four finishers have the lowest score, the winner of the race scoring 1 and so on upwards.</li>
<li>The Veterans' 40 race for The Old Brentwood's Trophy, participants to be aged 40 or over on race day, with three to score.</li>
<li>The Veterans' 50 race for The Chataway Trophy, participants to be aged 50 or over on race day, with three to score.</li>
<li>The Veterans' 60 race for The Old Denstonian Cup, participants to be aged 60 or over on race day, with three to score.</li>
<p>In any of the competitions, in the event that two or more teams have the same score, the advantage will lie with the team whose last scoring finisher has the lowest score. Incomplete teams may participate and are closed in accordance with the Surrey Rules.<br>Note that a teams made up of current pupils of a school are very welcome to participate informally but would not be eligible for any of the competitions.<br>If you are not already on the Thames list, please email the Convenor - David Jenkins - on dcbjenkins@aol.com.
