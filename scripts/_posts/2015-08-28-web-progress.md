Our web designer, Llewellyn Brunsdon, started work in earnest. There will be some choices for members to make next week...


 We are experimenting with different CSS frameworks; the current candidate is <a href="http://www.getmdl.io/">Material Design Lite</a> from Google.

Pretty soon we'll be asking Thames members for feedback.  Here are some key questions:

 - What colours do we want?  Do we stick with the time-honoured black and white, with a certain number of shades of grey to add some raciness, and some gorgeous photography?  Or does Thames finally discover colout?  If so, take your pick from the colour wheel at the bottom of <a href="http://www.getmdl.io/styles/index.html">this page</a>

 - What pages do we want, and how do we get to them?  We're porting every 'named page' from the old site.  Ideally the top 4-5 would be on the top menu, and the others which are less urgent can be linked in the footer.
 
 - Do we have a Thames email address, Twitter account, Facebook page etc? Links can go in the footer

- Imagery - any suggestions for the front page?  Or stay minimal?

I have some plans to sort out the display of results.
