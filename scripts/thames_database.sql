Mob matches however can only be won with a big team performance and everyone who ran played their part in two fine wins for the club. \r\n', '<pre>\r\n  1  John Macfarlane           THH   41.39\r\n  2  Ian Harkness              THH   41.46\r\n  3  Nick Altmann              THH   42.49\r\n  4  Paul Doyle              V RAN   42.54\r\n  5  Duncan Bell               RAN   43.17\r\n  6  Richard Kingsnorth        OH    43.53\r\n  7  Hugh Jones              V RAN   43.58\r\n  8  Peter Haarer              RAN   44.23\r\n  9  Richard Xerri             (G)   44.44\r\n 10  David Symons              THH   44.53\r\n 11  Simon Wurr                THH   45.02\r\n 12  Mark Gilbertson           THH   45.04\r\n 13  David Baker             V SLH   45.12\r\n 14  Pete Woodburn             THH   45.22\r\n 15  Chris Finill            V THH   45.29\r\n 16  Mike Airey              V SLH   45.30\r\n 17  Ben Osborn                (G)   45.45\r\n 18  Tom Samuel              J THH   45.48\r\n 19  Neil McGoun               OH    45.50\r\n 20  Andy Bickerstaff        V RAN   45.56\r\n 21  Jonas Theto               OH    46.04\r\n 22  Matt Lynas                THH   46.08\r\n 23  Andy Collins            V SLH   46.11\r\n 24  Shay Joyce                OH    46.17\r\n 25  Eric Paul               V OH    46.18\r\n 26  Larry Matthews          V THH   46.21\r\n 27  John Wallis             V OH    46.35\r\n 28  Barry Coulter             OH    46.40\r\n 29  Naomi Warner        (L)   THH   46.42\r\n 30  Pablo Lazo                THH   46.52\r\n 31  N.Humphreys               BH    46.52\r\n 32  Kevin Julian            V OH    47.00\r\n 33  A.Cliff                 J BH    47.02\r\n 34  Ed Barker                 RAN   47.04\r\n 35  Hugh Brasher              RAN   47.06\r\n 36  Dave Brock              V OH    47.10\r\n 37  Dave Ogden              V SLH   47.11\r\n 38  Danielle Sale       (L) J OH    47.17\r\n 39  Nic Gould                 THH   47.31\r\n 40  Mark Burtwell           V SLH   47.37\r\n 41  Alastair Kennis           THH   47.59\r\n 42  Andy Davis                SLH   48.06\r\n 43  John Barnard            V RAN   48.12\r\n 44  Aaron Farmer            J OH    48.17\r\n 45  Chris Owens             V RAN   48.29\r\n 46  James Young               OH    48.52\r\n 47  Peter Weir              V RAN   48.52\r\n 48  Gordon Whitson          V RAN   48.58\r\n 49  Marc Snaith               RAN   48.59\r\n 50  Trevor Maguire          V RAN   49.15\r\n 51  Steve Paddock             THH   49.16\r\n 52  M Cranwell                THH   49.17\r\n 53  Richard Turner          V THH   49.20\r\n 54  G.Cook                  V BH    49.23\r\n 55  Marcus Gohar            V RAN   49.27\r\n 56  P.   ?

Herne Hill Harriers joined the fray fresh from their triumph in one of the most bruising and violent Surrey League campaigns since the infamous Belgrave massacre of 2000.  Thames had put up a valiant struggle all winter and it soon became clear that it wasn’t just over the mud that these two clubs desired to wage all out war, but over the oche too.  \r\n36 players descended upon the stage, with no fewer than 15 supplied by Thames, armed with a handful of reserves, wives, girlfriends, infants, and newborns – all designed to intimidate or distract the opposition.  The format was for each club to play 6 doubles matches against each other club, thus 18 points to fight over.  \r\nDefending champions Belgrave came out of the blocks like startled Rottweilers and armed with their secret weapon Mark Humphrey, who had his opponents, spectators and referee cowering in trepidation, surged into a 2, 1, 1 lead.  Thereafter Belgrave struck something of a void for the next hour or two, as they gallantly offered the floor to Thames and Herne Hill to try and rip each other’s kidneys out, as they so desired.   \r\nHerne Hill tore into a 5, 3, 2 lead but then Thames had a purple patch in the final three-quarters of an hour, and with the final two matches out on the course they led 7, 6, 3.  However, both of those matches involved Herne Hill, and only one Thames.  Belgrave were wounded furry animals by now and the wise heads were already chalking up another point to the Brixton bombers.  Thus, the deciding match saw Larry Mathews and Ian Harkness going into a nip-and-tuck race with Spencer Mason and Keith Newton.  Neither team was able to conjure up a 9-dart finish in their 501 match, but both were flirting with the equally rare 90-dart finish.  \r\nHerne Hill had the slim lead and looked as though they’d have first go at the out-shot; but then Mathews, multiple-Surrey League winner, and undefeated in two years of Flyder Cups stepped up.  A high-scoring dart gave him the out-shot – double seven.  He took brief aim and pulled the trigger.  DOUBLE-SEVENS – very first dart!

In the early stages, it looked as if these hopes would be fulfilled with Naomi Taschimowitz and fresher Amanda Scott taking the lead and the main body of the Light Blue team packed in the middle order.\r\n<p class=''story_text''>\r\nHowever, as the course flattened out towards the half-way point, it was the Dark Blues who started to emerge ominously with Michelle Sikes, last year’s winner, moving into second and solid support forming behind her, which picked off the Cambridge runners and crucially relegated their fourth scorer to 10th. With Oxford holding a narrow advantage as the runners hit the heavy mud of the last mile, the result was still in doubt. However, the Dark Blues’ strong team work mean that they were able to hold their positions and secure a 17 points to 21 victory and a 21-13 overall series lead.\r\n<p class=''story_text''>\r\nBuoyed by their ladies’ performance, the youthful, but talented, Oxford gentlemen’s team produced an outstanding performance to take the honours in the 119th race of their series. Prior expectations had been that Cambridge’s more experienced team might just have the edge over the very wet 7½ mile course. \r\n<p class=''story_text''>\r\nHowever, with last year’s first two, Richard Franzese and David Bruce, once again making the running, accompanied by team-mate, Andrew Heyes, and experienced Light Blues, James Kelly, Oxford has a strong presence at the front of the race from the off.\r\n<p class=''story_text''>\r\nBehind them, and emulating their ladies’ team, they were backed-up by good support work, in particular, with impressive performances from the freshers Jake Shelley and Luke Caldwell.\r\n<p class=''story_text''>\r\nBy the time the runners headed out to Parkside, just after half-way, they were 20 points up and it appeared that only misfortune could deny them. However, it was to be their day and with Andrew Heyes pulling away from Kelly in the closing stages, they were able to secure a 1-2-3 and a 28 points to 52 victory.

(1421, 'THE MOST AMAZING SPRINT FINISH ..............EVER', 'LADIES SURREY LEAGUE Ruth puts in incredible sprint that had all the audience and supporters totally engaged, and screaming themselves ragged.', 'At the third fixture of the Ladies'' Surrey League held for the first time at Mitcham Common (courtesy of Clapham Chasers) where the course included at least 9 sharp hills, Ruth ran the most tactical race.  Ruth was determined to put wrong to right.  That meant beating Tish Jones (Belgrave) although Ruth did beat her at the South of the Thames but over the longer distance of 7.5 miles.  Hanging on to Tish until the final muddy and slippery downhill, Ruth then went for it and left Tish struggling to keep the pace, and  going on to win by 2 exciting seconds.  The Thames Ladies were short of a few of their speedier runners but nevertheless those who represented the club, ran their hearts out and we finished just 2 points behind Belgrave in 3rd place, with Dulwich winning with a very strong team.  We are still in the lead by a narrow 38 points.  This means a build-up to get the best possible squad out for an increasingly tense final at Denbies Vineyard on Saturday 9th February.  This is not to be missed!  We are the holders for the 3rd year running and we do not want to give up our title lightly.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1.  Ruth Clifton          31.57</pre>\r\n<p> 2.

(1422, 'THE MOST AMAZING SPRINT FINISH ..............EVER', 'LADIES SURREY LEAGUE Ruth puts in incredible sprint that had all the audience and supporters totally engaged, and screaming themselves ragged.', 'At the third fixture of the Ladies'' Surrey League held for the first time at Mitcham Common (courtesy of Clapham Chasers) where the course included at least 9 sharp hills, Ruth ran the most tactical race.  Ruth was determined to put wrong to right.  That meant beating Tish Jones (Belgrave) although Ruth did beat her at the South of the Thames but over the longer distance of 7.5 miles.  Hanging on to Tish until the final muddy and slippery downhill, Ruth then went for it and left Tish struggling to keep the pace, and  going on to win by 2 exciting seconds.  The Thames Ladies were short of a few of their speedier runners but nevertheless those who represented the club, ran their hearts out and we finished just 2 points behind Belgrave in 3rd place, with Dulwich winning with a very strong team.  We are still in the lead by a narrow 38 points.  This means a build-up to get the best possible squad out for an increasingly tense final at Denbies Vineyard on Saturday 9th February.  This is not to be missed!  We are the holders for the 3rd year running and we do not want to give up our title lightly.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1.  Ruth Clifton          31.57</pre>\r\n<p> 2.

Her reward was the Christine Keeler Cup, for the receipt of which she re-created the same''s famous pose in a deck chair.\r\n<p/>\r\n\r\nIn the Men''s race, John Clark completed a stunning hat-trick, but Al Irvine was awarded the Dr Who Time Traveller''s Trophy for the fastest Vet, just out sprinting Jeffrey Gordon. \r\n<p/>\r\n\r\nThe Children''s 400m race was the thriller of the day, and as a rampant Matthew Irvine was set off some 75 yards after the main pack, the Clark twins were held back for another 50 yards by the militant handicapper.  Matthew duly caught the pack at 250; but with still 150 to go, he was tiring and the girls scented blood. At the frantic urgings of the crowd Matthew found gear five just in time and crossed the line with two ticks to spare.\r\n<p/>\r\n\r\nNick Altmann and Claire Day took an early lead in the highly anticipated wheelbarrow race until Nick collapsed a couple of meters from the finish.  Nic and Annette managed to catch up, only for Nick to revive himself to take the win with Claire for the Lady Chatterley Cup.\r\n<p/>\r\n\r\nThe great swag bag relay, trying to drink a can of lager and then run 100m carrying a sack, separated the wheat from the hops.  It was all square going into the anchor leg, only for the men''s captain to hand a severe lesson to Claire in the skills of this particular task.\r\n<p/>\r\n\r\nThe tug of war over Beverely Brook was atmospheric and hard-fought, with the losing team on top for most of the first half, only for the eventual winners to find various trees and roots with which to use for leverage. The losing team threw in the rope before being dragged into the slimy depths.\r\n<p/>\r\nThanks to everyone who came along and made this afternoon so fun.

(1480, 'The Original Mud Run - Running Times, 22 August 2013', 'New Zealand-based Thames member, Roger Robinson, recently penned an article on the history of cross-country and Thames for the Running Times. The article is below.', 'Mud runs seem to be new and trendy, but they are a variant on an old way of running for fun - almost 200 years old. We can date it to 1819 for schoolboys and 1867 as a sport for adults. That''s when a group of Londoners began to get together on Saturday afternoons to run over natural terrain outside the city. They called their runs a steeplechase, or hare and hounds paper hunt.<br>\r\nIf that sounds soft, it wasn''t. They chose "the roughest and boggiest parts of Wimbledon Common." They waded through one notorious, muddy section named the Dismal Swamp, struggled over a switchback of steep gullies, swam rivers, leaped fences and hedges, got tangled by thickets and lashed by "cold driving rain." They ran in gales, snow and pea-soup fog. Because they were busy Victorian-era city workers who could not start running, even on Saturday, until 4 p.m., they often ran most of the distance in the dark. Moonlight on the lake was much admired. Courses went up to 20 miles, plus false trails. They were regularly running more than 4 hours. Oh, and there were no showers. You sat knees-up in a Victorian hip bath filled from a huge enamel jug. After you scrubbed, if you were macho enough, you lifted the heavy iron bath and tipped the soiled water over your own head.<br>\r\nMud-run warriors of today, try time-traveling back to 1868.<br>\r\nThat was the year when these enthusiasts formed a club called Thames Hare and Hounds. It''s the world''s oldest adult running organization and played a key part in the early history of running. They initiated the first team races, against the "Gentlemen of Hampstead." They put on the first allcomers race, inviting the north of England''s best runner, "Choppy" Warburton. When they failed to run him off his legs, they tried to drown him, taking the course through "a very wide and deep part of the ancient Hog''s Mill River." Choppy proved the best swimmer and won the race.<br>\r\nStories like that light up the club''s new history, Follow the Saltire: The Annals of Thames Hare and Hounds, 1868-2012. It''s written partly by top journalist John Bryant, author of The London Marathon, with other master storytellers, ancient and modern. There was the day the best runner was "delayed by a morass at the bottom of a ravine." There was the bitterly cold day when the "very difficult country" included waist-deep black mud and a swim across the River Wandle, where they tried to throw their jerseys over before plunging in. There was the weary runner who was "overcome by his feelings at the sight of the last hill" and took a (horse-drawn) cab home. And there was the Canadian doctor who joined in 1874 and persuaded the club to try lacrosse, so they were the first in London to play that sport, too. They combined it with a warm-up run and a handicap half-mile race to ensure they got enough exercise.<br>\r\nIt wasn''t all mud games. They also discovered the essential human joy of running fast over natural surfaces. Paperchases morphed into cross country racing, and a major new sport was created, the cradle of the whole modern running movement. In 1877, only 10 years after the first hare and hounds run, they established the Championship of England, open to all comers, still one of the world''s great races. By the 1880s there were races in France and Belgium, and in 1903 the first international championship was held.<br>\r\nThe sport had reached the United States by 1890, when the fledgling Amateur Athletic Union founded the U.S. cross country championship. First winner was William Day of New Jersey AC, the team title going to Prospect Harriers of Brooklyn. Collegiate racing began by 1899, dominated in early years by Cornell University, according to Marc Bloom''s indispensable book Cross-Country Running (1978).<br>\r\nOften the going was tough. Bloom cites a report that the 1908 New York public schools race near Long Island City was run over "several hills, rough edges and stony patches of ground and tangled masses of shrubbery." That sounds similar to my own most-recent outing in England with Thames Hare and Hounds in April this year, up and down the tangled rough hills of the scenic Wye Valley. Thames wouldn''t dream of calling it a Warrior or Mud Run. But, as the Bible says, there is nothing new under the sun. Especially with something as old and enjoyable as running.', '2013-08-22'),
