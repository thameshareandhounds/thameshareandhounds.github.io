Veterans
===========

The Club has a thriving veteran’s section and contests both County and National level veterans’ cross-country and road relay championships. In 2013 and again in 2015 the Club took home gold medals at the National Mens Masters’ Road Relays Championships and both men and women individual runners have taken medals at World Masters Athletic Championships.
