When and where we meet
======================

The Club meets for regular runs at its headquarters on Wimbledon Common located on the A3 by the Richardsons Evans Memorial Playing Fields. There is ample parking by the club house. On Wednesday evenings we meet here at 7.30pm, after which we retire for refreshments and carbo-loading at the Telegraph pub on Putney Heath (although the Captain will occasionally put out a call for a different watering hole). Runs tend to last between five and ten miles.

Our other regular run is the Second Sunday 5 which also doubles as a 5 miles race. This takes place from the Clubhouse every second Sunday of the month and is free to club members. Entries can be made on the day or through the race website at www.secondsunday5.com. The route follows a fine 5 mile circuit around Wimbledon Common. Spikes or trail shoes are advised for the wettest depths of winter. The Club provides tea, muffins and camaraderie at the Clubhouse afterwards.

A number of Thames runners also do a high quality interval session at the Kingsmeadow track, Norbiton from 7:30pm on Tuesday nights. This run is a joint collective with other clubs across South West London. In the winter the Club alternates bi-weekly the track session with a road-hill session starting from Ham Gate, Richmond Park at 7:30pm.

Thames members are scattered across all parts of the South East and many have regular training runs of their own. All are happy for new members to join them. Please see [link to PDF] and feel free to contact any of the runners listed.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list which lists all club training activities, please contact current Club Captain Matthew Jones (<m4ttjones@yahoo.co.uk>)
